## Edition 1: "The webinar sitting in your Zoom folder"

**Subject Line A:** That webinar in your Zoom folder is worth more than you think
**Subject Line B:** You spent 10 hours on a webinar. Then what?

**Preview Text:** Your best content is already made. It's collecting dust.

---

You recorded a webinar last month. Maybe last quarter. You promoted it, showed up live, answered questions for an hour. Then you saved the recording to a folder and moved on.

That webinar is sitting there right now with enough material for weeks of content. And it's doing nothing.

Here's what most coaches don't realize: a single 60-minute webinar contains 8,000-10,000 words of spoken content. That's more raw material than most people produce in a month of writing.

The problem isn't that you lack content. You have too much of it trapped in a format nobody will watch twice. A 60-minute recording doesn't get shared on LinkedIn. It doesn't rank on Google. It doesn't show up when someone asks ChatGPT for advice on your topic.

But the ideas inside that recording? Those can go everywhere.

**The frameworks you taught. The client stories you shared. The questions your audience asked.** All of that can become blog posts, social content, email sequences, and lead magnets. Content that actually gets found.

Here's something you can do this week: open your Zoom or Loom folder. Find your most recent webinar. Watch the first 10 minutes and write down every distinct idea or tip you mentioned. Most people find 5-8 individual content topics in the first 10 minutes alone.

I wrote a full breakdown of what webinar repurposing actually means (and what it produces) here:

If you'd rather skip the DIY route and have someone turn your next webinar into a full content library, that's what we do. You can see how it works here: https://cal.com/contentrepurposehub/30min

## Edition 2: "One webinar, 14 pieces -- here's the math"

**Subject Line A:** One webinar, 14 content pieces -- here's the exact breakdown
**Subject Line B:** The math behind turning 1 hour into a month of content

**Preview Text:** 14 pieces minimum. Here's what each one is.

---

Last week I mentioned that your webinars are full of untapped content. This week, I want to show you exactly what "repurposing" means in practice. Not theory. Actual pieces.

Here's what a single 60-minute webinar becomes:

**1 long-form blog post** (2,000+ words, SEO-optimized) -- this is your Google traffic driver.

**1 email sequence** (3-5 emails pulled from key teaching points) -- nurture content, done.

**5-7 social media posts** (quotes, tips, short insights from things you actually said) -- no more staring at a blank LinkedIn post.

**2-3 short video clips** (60-90 seconds, subtitled) -- the moments your audience reacted to.

**1 lead magnet** (PDF guide or checklist based on your framework) -- grows your email list.

**1 FAQ page or blog section** (from the Q&A portion) -- ranks for long-tail searches.

That's 14 pieces minimum. Some webinars produce 30-75+, depending on length and depth.

The math on time: creating those 14 pieces from scratch would take 20-30 hours. Repurposing from a webinar that already exists? The content is already created. It needs extraction, formatting, and optimization -- not invention.

Here's something you can do this week: take your last webinar and pull 3 direct quotes from it. Post one on LinkedIn with a one-sentence setup. See what happens. That's repurposing at its simplest.

I broke down the full content-piece-by-piece process here:
https://contentrepurposehub.com/blog/webinar-content-pieces-breakdown

If 20-30 hours of content extraction sounds like time you don't have (and your time is better spent coaching clients), we handle the whole process for $750-$1,500/month. Book a call to see if it fits: https://cal.com/contentrepurposehub/30min

## Edition 3: "Why AI search matters more than you think"

**Subject Line A:** AI assistants are recommending your competitors right now
**Subject Line B:** The new search channel most coaches don't know about

**Preview Text:** ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini are answering your audience's questions. Without you.

---

Something shifted in the last year that most coaches haven't noticed yet.

Your potential clients aren't only Googling their problems anymore. They're asking ChatGPT. They're using Perplexity. They're talking to Gemini. And those AI tools are giving specific recommendations -- names, websites, services.

If your content isn't structured in a way AI can find and reference, you're invisible in this new channel. Your competitors who do have well-structured content? They're getting recommended instead.

This isn't a future problem. It's happening now. **Over 100 million people use ChatGPT weekly.** A growing percentage of them ask for service recommendations, coaching advice, and expert suggestions.

Here's what determines whether AI recommends you: the same things that drive good Google SEO, plus structured data (like FAQ schema, clear service descriptions, and topical authority across multiple pages). If you have one vague website page and no blog content, AI has nothing to reference. You don't exist in that world.

The coaches who are building content libraries right now -- blog posts, FAQ pages, detailed service descriptions -- are training AI to know who they are. That's a real competitive advantage with a short window.

Here's something you can do this week: open ChatGPT and type "Who are the best [your niche] coaches?" or "What's the best way to [problem you solve]?" See what comes up. If you're not there, you have a visibility gap.

I wrote a full guide on how AI search optimization works (and what to do about it) here:
https://contentrepurposehub.com/blog/ai-search-optimization-guide

Every content piece we create is optimized for both Google and AI search engines. No extra charge, no separate package. If you want to see what that looks like for your webinars, grab a time here: https://cal.com/contentrepurposehub/30min

## Edition 4: "The $54 content piece vs. the $500 content piece"

**Subject Line A:** A blog post costs $500. Unless you already recorded the content.
**Subject Line B:** The $54 content piece vs. the $500 content piece

**Preview Text:** The cost math changes when the raw material already exists.

---

Hiring a freelance writer to produce one quality blog post costs $300-$500. A social media manager runs $1,500-$3,000/month for a few posts per week. A video editor charges $100-$200 per short clip.

Those are fair prices for creating content from nothing. The problem is, you're not starting from nothing. You already have the content. It's in your webinars.

Here's where the math gets interesting.

Our repurposing service produces 14+ pieces per month for $750-$1,500. That's **$54-$107 per content piece** -- and every piece is based on your actual words, your frameworks, your stories. Not some freelancer guessing at your voice.

Compare that:
- Freelance blog post: **$300-$500** per piece
- Repurposed blog post: **$54-$107** per piece (extracted from your webinar, SEO-optimized)
- Freelance social posts: **$75-$150** each if you're paying a manager
- Repurposed social posts: **included** in the same $750-$1,500

The quality difference matters too. A freelancer has to research your topic, guess your tone, and hope they capture your expertise. Repurposed content starts with your exact words. The voice match is built in.

And the time savings: you spend zero additional hours creating. The webinar you already recorded is the only input. No briefs, no revision cycles, no "can you make this sound more like me?" emails.

Here's something you can do this week: add up what you spent on content creation last month -- writers, designers, video editors, your own time at your hourly rate. Compare that to what 14+ pieces at $750 would cost. The gap is usually significant.

I broke down the full cost comparison with specific numbers here:
