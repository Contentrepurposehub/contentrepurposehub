| 4 | zapier.com | Blog: "5 Ways Marketers Can Repurpose Webinar Content" |
| 5 | getcontrast.io | Guide: "7 Ways to Repurpose Your Webinar" |

**ContentRepurposeHub ranking:** NOT FOUND

**Key insight:** Dominated by platform/SaaS company blogs (ON24, Zapier, Contrast). No dedicated agency content in top 5.

---

### Query: "webinar to social media content service"

**Who ranks on Google (top results):**
| Position | Domain | Content Type |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | socialpilot.co | Webinars page (not a match — their own webinars) |

| 5 | sproutsocial.com | Webinars page |

**ContentRepurposeHub ranking:** NOT FOUND

**Key insight:** This query returns mostly social media management tools, not repurposing services. Google is interpreting "webinar" + "social media" as webinar promotion, not repurposing. This is a **mismatched intent query** — our content should target "repurpose webinar for social media" instead.

---

### Query: "DFY webinar repurposing"

**Who ranks on Google (top results):**
| Position | Domain | Content Type |

| 5 | getwebinarkit.com | Service page: "White Glove DFY Webinars" |

**ContentRepurposeHub ranking:** NOT FOUND

## Competitive Intelligence Summary

### Top Competitors by Frequency of Appearance

| Competitor | Queries Appearing In | Threat Level |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| repurposemywebinar.com | 3 (best service, agency, DFY) | HIGH — closest competitor, similar positioning |
| kometmedia.com | 2 (agency, DFY) | MEDIUM — unlimited model, different niche focus |
| goldcast.io | 2 (agency, comparison) | MEDIUM — enterprise/B2B focus, not coach-focused |
| on24.com | 2 (blog posts, webinar) | LOW — platform blog, not a service |
| willowpaule.com | 1 (coaches) | MEDIUM — DFY service for coaches specifically |
| contentfries.com | 1 (DFY) | LOW — DIY tool, not a service |
| univid.io | 1 (best service) | LOW — platform, not a service |
| quso.ai | 1 (coaches) | LOW — tool, not a service |

### Gaps and Opportunities

1. **repurposemywebinar.com is our #1 competitor** — appears in 3 of 7 queries. They have a listicle-style blog post that ranks for multiple queries. Our listicle ("Best Webinar Repurposing Services for Coaches") directly competes.

2. **No one owns "content repurposing for coaches"** — the current top results are a mix of small blogs and service pages. Our complete guide has a strong chance of ranking here.

3. **"DFY webinar repurposing" is low competition** — only 1 comparison article in top 5. Our planned DIY vs Service post (#11) should be fast-tracked.

4. **"webinar to social media content service" has mismatched intent** — Google shows webinar promotion tools, not repurposing. We should retarget to "repurpose webinar for social media" or "turn webinar into social media posts."

5. **AI search engines have ZERO coverage of this niche** — Hive-Rank shows no contributors searching any webinar repurposing queries. This means AI engines are likely pulling from Google's top results. Getting into Google top 10 = getting cited by AI.
