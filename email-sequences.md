## Conversion Architecture

Every email solves one buying objection and pushes toward the decision.

| Email | Objection It Kills | Emotional Shift |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | "What did I sign up for? Who is this person?" | Curiosity → "This person gets my problem" |
| 2 | "Is repurposing actually worth it?" | "Maybe later" → "I'm wasting money every month" |
| 3 | "What would I actually get?" | Vague idea → "I can picture this with MY webinar" |
| 4 | "Can I just do this myself?" | "I'll DIY it" → "I don't have 15 hours for this" |
| 5 | "Why should I act now?" | "I'll think about it" → "Let me just book the call" |

Single CTA per email. Blog links only in P.S. — never the main action.

## Email 1: Deliver the Checklist + Introduce Yourself

**Send:** Immediately
**Subject Line A:** Your checklist is here — plus a quick story
**Subject Line B:** 14 content ideas hiding in your webinars (checklist inside)
**Preview text:** I built this because I kept seeing the same mistake.
**CTA:** Try the exercise + reply with how many recordings they have

Hey,

Your checklist is here: **14 Content Ideas from Your Next Webinar**

[DOWNLOAD THE CHECKLIST]

Quick story about why I made this.

I kept noticing the same thing with coaches who run webinars. They spend 4-6 hours preparing, delivering, answering questions — pouring everything they know into a single session. Real frameworks. Real stories. Real expertise.

Then the recording goes into a folder. And the next week, they sit down and create content from scratch. New LinkedIn posts. New blog ideas. New newsletter topics. All while hours of their best thinking sits on a hard drive.

That bothered me. So I built a service around fixing it.

**Here's what I want you to try right now:** Open the checklist next to your most recent webinar recording. Go through the 14 content types and count how many you could pull from that one session.

Most people get to 8 or 9 before they stop and think "...I've been wasting this."

Quick question — hit reply: **How many webinar recordings do you have sitting in a folder right now?**

I read every reply. I'll send you a few more emails this week showing you what that number actually means for your business.

P.S. That checklist shows you what's possible. But the real question isn't "what CAN I create from my webinars?" It's "do I have 15-20 hours to actually do it?" More on that in my next email.

## Email 2: Make Inaction Painful

**Send:** Day 2
**Subject Line A:** This is probably costing you $4,500/month
**Subject Line B:** The most expensive content you'll ever make is the content you create from scratch
**Preview text:** Quick math that might change how you think about content.
**CTA:** Reply with their hourly rate

---

I want to run some numbers with you. This might sting a little.

What do you charge clients? $200 an hour? $300? $500?

Now — how many hours per month do you spend on content? Writing LinkedIn posts. Drafting newsletters. Brainstorming topics. Formatting for different platforms.

For most coaches who run webinars, it's 10-15 hours a month. Sometimes more.

Let me show you what that actually costs:

| Your rate | Hours on content | What it costs you |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| $200/hr | 15 hrs/month | **$3,000/month** |
| $300/hr | 15 hrs/month | **$4,500/month** |
| $500/hr | 15 hrs/month | **$7,500/month** |

That's $36,000-$90,000 a year. Not on coaching. Not on growing your business. On writing social media posts.

And here's the part that hurts: **you already have the content.** It's in your webinar recordings. The frameworks. The stories. The answers to every question your audience asks. All sitting in a folder, unused.

You're spending 15 hours a month creating content from scratch while hours of your best material collects dust.

The question isn't "can I afford a repurposing service?"

The question is "can I afford to keep doing this myself?"

**Try this:** reply with your hourly rate. Then multiply it by the hours you spend on content each month. That number is what DIY content is really costing you.

Next email: I'll show you exactly what comes back when a webinar gets repurposed — every single piece, laid out.

P.S. If you want the full breakdown with real numbers, [I wrote it here](https://contentrepurposehub.com/blog/webinar-repurposing-roi). Short version: if repurposing saves you even 5 hours a month, it pays for itself.

## Email 3: Show Exactly What They'd Get

**Send:** Day 4
**Subject Line A:** Here's what one webinar turns into (piece by piece)
**Subject Line B:** 1 recording in, 14 content pieces out
**Preview text:** Lead magnet, 10 LinkedIn posts, blog post, newsletter, landing page. All from one recording.
**CTA:** Visualize this with their own webinar

---

You've seen the checklist. You've seen the math. Now let me show you what it actually looks like when a webinar gets fully repurposed.

**You send in one 60-minute recording. Here's what comes back:**

**A lead magnet** that pulls your best framework out of the webinar and turns it into a downloadable PDF. This goes on your website and builds your email list while you sleep. Not a generic freebie — YOUR methodology, packaged so people want it.

**10 LinkedIn posts** written from your actual words in the recording. Your stories. Your one-liners. Your insights. They sound like you because they came from you. Two of them are carousel posts breaking down your key concepts — the kind that get saved and shared.

**A blog post (1,500-2,500 words)** optimized for Google AND AI search engines. When someone searches for your topic — or asks ChatGPT "who's a good coach for [your thing]?" — this is what shows up. It drives traffic to your site for months. Even years.

**A newsletter edition** ready to send to your list. Consistent with everything else because it all came from the same source.

**Landing page copy** for your lead magnet or offer page. Written to convert visitors into leads.

**That's 14 pieces from one recording you already have.**

Now picture this with YOUR last webinar. The one about [whatever their topic is]. That recording sitting in your Zoom folder right now — imagine it turning into a lead magnet that builds your list, 10 LinkedIn posts that position you as the go-to expert, and a blog post that shows up when people search for what you teach.

That's not hypothetical. That's what the service does. Every piece in your voice, optimized for search, delivered in 7-10 business days.

Growth plan ($1,000/month) does this with 2 webinars — 32+ pieces plus email sequences. Scale ($1,500/month) does 4 webinars — 75+ pieces across every platform.

Next email: the honest truth about doing this yourself.

Marius

P.S. Every piece uses your actual words from the webinar. No templates. No generic AI output. The content sounds like you because it IS you — just restructured for each platform and optimized for search.

## Email 4: Kill the DIY Objection

**Send:** Day 6
**Subject Line A:** You could do this yourself (here's what that looks like)
**Subject Line B:** The honest truth about DIY repurposing
**Preview text:** It works. But it takes 15-20 hours per webinar.
**CTA:** "Which camp are you in?" — reply to self-select

---

I'm going to be straight with you.

You can do this yourself. The checklist works. There are good tools — Descript, ChatGPT, Castmagic. The process isn't rocket science.

But here's what DIY actually takes:

- **2 hours** watching the webinar, taking notes, finding the key moments
- **3-5 hours** writing and optimizing the blog post for SEO
- **2-3 hours** creating the lead magnet and landing page
- **3-4 hours** writing 10 LinkedIn posts adapted for the algorithm
- **1-2 hours** writing the newsletter and formatting everything
- **1-2 hours** optimizing for AI search engines

**Total: 15-20 hours per webinar.** That's a part-time job on top of your actual job.

Some coaches have that time. If you do — genuinely — use the checklist. It works.

But if you're like most coaches I hear from, you're already stretched between client sessions, business development, preparing webinars, and having a life. Adding 15-20 hours of content work isn't realistic. It stays on the to-do list. The recording folder keeps growing.

At $750/month, the Starter plan handles one webinar and gives you those 15-20 hours back. That's about $50 per content piece. A freelance writer charges $200-$500 for a single blog post — without search optimization.

**You're in one of two camps right now:**

**Camp A:** "I have the time and I want to DIY this." Great. Use the checklist. I'll keep sending useful stuff.

**Camp B:** "I'd rather spend those hours on coaching and let someone handle the content." If that's you, reply and say **"Camp B."** I'll send you what you need to get started.

Marius

P.S. The hidden cost of DIY isn't the tools. It's your time. At $300/hour, 15 hours = $4,500/month. The service is $750. [Full pricing comparison here.](https://contentrepurposehub.com/blog/content-repurposing-cost-pricing)

## Email 5: Book the Call

**Send:** Day 8
**Subject Line A:** 20 minutes — I'll show you what's hiding in your webinar
**Subject Line B:** Let's look at your webinar together (free, 20 min)
**Preview text:** I'll point out the exact content opportunities you're missing.
**CTA:** Book the strategy call. One link. One action.

---

Here's where we stand.

You know a webinar can become 14-75+ content pieces. You've seen the math — DIY costs more in time than hiring it out. You know what you'd get back.

One question left: **does this make sense for your specific webinars?**

I can answer that in 20 minutes.

**[BOOK A FREE STRATEGY CALL](https://cal.com/contentrepurposehub/30min)**

On the call, you tell me about your webinars — topics, audience, how often you run them. I'll point out the specific content hiding in them: the lead magnet angle, the LinkedIn hooks, the blog keywords. Then we figure out if a plan makes sense. If it doesn't, I'll tell you.

**Two things worth knowing:**

**I'm building this business right now.** That means I have time and capacity to give early clients more attention than any agency juggling 50 accounts would. More revisions. More care. More back-and-forth until the content sounds exactly like you. That window won't last forever, but right now it's yours.

**First month is a test.** You send one webinar, we send back the content. If it doesn't sound like you, if the quality isn't there — you cancel. No contract. No penalty. You keep everything we created. I'd rather prove it with real work than promise it with words.

**[BOOK YOUR STRATEGY CALL — 20 MINUTES](https://cal.com/contentrepurposehub/30min)**

Every month those recordings sit in a folder, that's content not driving traffic to your business. And search rankings compound — the earlier you start, the bigger the head start.

Marius
ContentRepurposeHub

P.S. Not ready for a call? No problem. Just reply and tell me about your webinars — how many you have, what topics they cover. I'll give you a quick take on what we could do with them. No call needed.
