## Conversion Architecture

Every email solves one buying objection and pushes toward the decision.

| Email | Objection It Kills | Emotional Shift |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | "What did I sign up for?" | Curiosity → "This is bigger than I thought" |
| 2 | "Is this actually worth my time/money?" | Skepticism → "I'm losing money by NOT doing this" |
| 3 | "What would I actually get back?" | Vague → "I can see exactly what I'd receive" |
| 4 | "Can I just do this myself?" | "I'll DIY it" → "I don't have 15 hours for this" |
| 5 | "How do I start?" | Hesitation → "Let me just book the call" |

Single CTA per email. Blog links only as supporting evidence in P.S. lines — never the main action.

## Email 1: Deliver + Plant the Seed

**Send:** Immediately
**Subject Line A:** Your checklist is here (14 content ideas hiding in your webinars)
**Subject Line B:** Here's your checklist — plus the one thing most coaches miss
**Preview text:** You're sitting on more content than you think.
**CTA:** Download checklist + reply with how many recordings they have

---

Hey,

Here's your checklist: **14 Content Ideas from Your Next Webinar**

[DOWNLOAD THE CHECKLIST]

Quick way to use it: open it next to your most recent webinar recording. Scan the checklist. Count how many of those 14 content types you could pull from that one recording.

Most coaches I talk to get to 8 or 9 before they stop and think "...I've been wasting this."

That's the realization. You already did the hardest part — the thinking, the teaching, the explaining. It's all recorded. You're just not extracting it.

Here's what I want you to notice over the next few days as I send you a few emails: **the gap between what you have and what you're using.** That gap is where your content marketing should be coming from.

Quick question — hit reply, I read everything: **How many webinar recordings do you have sitting in a folder right now?**

Talk soon,

ContentRepurposeHub

P.S. That checklist shows you 14 content types. But the real question isn't "what CAN I create?" It's "do I have 15-20 hours to create it?" I'll get into that next.

## Email 2: Make Inaction Painful

**Send:** Day 2
**Subject Line A:** This is costing you $4,500/month
**Subject Line B:** The most expensive content you'll ever create is the content you make from scratch
**Preview text:** Quick math that might change how you think about content.
**CTA:** Reply with their hourly rate (engagement + makes them do the math themselves)

---

Let's do some math.

What's your hourly rate? Whatever you charge clients — $200, $300, $500 an hour.

Now: how many hours per month do you spend creating content? Writing LinkedIn posts. Drafting newsletters. Brainstorming blog topics. Formatting everything for different platforms.

Most coaches I talk to say 10-15 hours. Some say 20.

At $300/hour, 15 hours of content creation = **$4,500/month in opportunity cost.** That's $54,000 a year of your time spent writing social posts when you could be coaching clients.

And here's what makes it worse: you already have the content. It's sitting in your webinar recordings. The frameworks. The stories. The examples. The answers to every question your audience asks. All recorded. All ready.

You're spending 15 hours a month creating new content when you have hours of existing content that nobody's touched.

The math isn't "can I afford a repurposing service?" The math is "can I afford to keep doing this myself?"

One webinar contains enough material for 14-75 pieces of content. You spent 4-6 hours creating that webinar. The content creation is already done. The extraction is what's missing.

I want you to do one thing: **reply with your hourly rate.** Then multiply it by the hours you spend on content each month. That number might surprise you.

Next email: I'll show you exactly what comes back when someone sends us a webinar recording. Every piece, laid out.

ContentRepurposeHub

P.S. If you want to see the full ROI breakdown with real numbers, [I wrote it here](https://contentrepurposehub.com/blog/webinar-repurposing-roi). But the short version: repurposing pays for itself if it saves you even 5 hours a month.

## Email 3: Show Exactly What They Get

**Send:** Day 4
**Subject Line A:** Here's exactly what you'd get back from one webinar
**Subject Line B:** 1 recording in, 14 content pieces out — here's the list
**Preview text:** Lead magnet, 10 LinkedIn posts, blog post, newsletter, emails, landing page copy.
**CTA:** "Picture this with YOUR last webinar" — plants the visualization

---

You've seen the checklist. You know the math. Now let me show you exactly what comes back when you hand over one webinar recording.

**From one 60-minute webinar, here's what we create on our Starter plan:**

**1 Lead Magnet (PDF)**
We find the core framework from your webinar and turn it into a downloadable checklist, workbook, or guide. This goes on your site and builds your email list while you sleep.

**10 LinkedIn Posts**
Your best stories, insights, one-liners, and frameworks — turned into posts that sound like you. Because they came from your actual words. Two of these will be carousel posts breaking down your key concepts.

**1 Blog Post (1,500-2,500 words)**
Keyword-optimized for Google. Structured for AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini). Drives organic traffic to your site for months — even years.

**1 Newsletter Edition**
Ready to send to your email list. Written from your webinar content so it's consistent with everything else.

**1 Landing Page Copy**
Conversion-optimized copy for your lead magnet or offer page.

That's **14 pieces. From one recording you already have.**

The Growth plan ($1,000/month) does this with 2 webinars and adds Twitter threads and a 3-email welcome sequence. The Scale plan ($1,500/month) does 4 webinars and adds Instagram captions, YouTube Short scripts, a content calendar, and a brand voice document. **75+ pieces.**

Here's what I want you to do: **think about your last webinar.** The one sitting in your Zoom or Google Drive folder. Picture that recording turning into a lead magnet that builds your list, 10 LinkedIn posts that position you as the authority, and a blog post that ranks on Google for your topic.

That's not hypothetical. That's what the service does.

Next email: the honest truth about doing this yourself (and when it makes sense to just hire it out).

ContentRepurposeHub

P.S. Every piece uses your actual words from the webinar. The content sounds like you because it IS you — just structured for each platform. No templates. No generic AI output.

## Email 4: Kill the DIY Objection

**Send:** Day 6
**Subject Line A:** You could do this yourself. Here's what that actually looks like.
**Subject Line B:** The honest truth about DIY repurposing
**Preview text:** It works. But it takes 15-20 hours per webinar. Here's the breakdown.
**CTA:** Force a decision — "Which camp are you in?"

---

I'm going to be honest with you.

You can absolutely do this yourself. The checklist I gave you works. The process isn't complicated. And there are good tools out there — Descript, Castmagic, ChatGPT — that can help.

Here's what DIY actually looks like:

**Hour 1-2:** Watch the webinar. Take notes. Identify the key moments, frameworks, stories, and one-liners.

**Hour 3-5:** Write the blog post. Research keywords. Optimize headings. Add internal links. Format for SEO.

**Hour 6-8:** Create the lead magnet. Design the PDF. Write the landing page copy.

**Hour 9-12:** Write 10 LinkedIn posts. Format carousels. Adapt each one for the platform algorithm.

**Hour 13-14:** Write the newsletter. Draft the email sequence.

**Hour 15+:** Optimize everything for AI search engines. Add structured data. Make sure it all connects.

**Total: 15-20 hours per webinar.** If you do one webinar per month, that's a part-time job.

Some coaches have that time. If you do, use the checklist. Seriously.

But most coaches I talk to are already stretched. Between client sessions, business development, preparing the next webinar, and actually living their life — adding 15-20 hours of content production isn't realistic. It stays on the to-do list. The folder keeps growing.

**That's the real decision: not "should I repurpose?" but "should I spend my time doing it?"**

At $750/month, our Starter plan handles one webinar and gives you back those 15-20 hours. That's roughly **$50 per content piece.** A freelance writer charges $200-$500 per piece. And they don't do SEO or AI search optimization.

You're in one of two camps right now:

**Camp A:** "I have the time and I want to do this myself." Great. Use the checklist. I'll keep sending you useful content.

**Camp B:** "I'd rather spend those 15 hours coaching clients and let someone else handle the content." If that's you, reply and say "Camp B." I'll send you everything you need to get started.

ContentRepurposeHub

P.S. The hidden cost of DIY isn't the tools ($100/month). It's your time. At $300/hour, 15 hours = $4,500. The service costs $750. [Full pricing comparison here.](https://contentrepurposehub.com/blog/content-repurposing-cost-pricing)

## Email 5: Remove All Friction — Book the Call

**Send:** Day 8
**Subject Line A:** 20 minutes. Let me show you what's hiding in your webinar.
**Subject Line B:** Let's look at your webinar together (free, 20 min)
**Preview text:** I'll pull up your recording and show you the content opportunities you're missing.
**CTA:** Book the strategy call. One link. One action.

---

Here's where we are.

You downloaded the checklist. You know a single webinar can become 14-75+ content pieces. You've seen the math — doing it yourself costs more in time than hiring it out. And you know exactly what you'd get back: lead magnets, LinkedIn posts, blog posts, newsletters, email sequences, all in your voice.

The only question left: **does this make sense for YOUR webinars?**

I can answer that in 20 minutes.

Here's what happens on the call:

1. **You tell me about your webinars.** Topics, audience, how often you run them.
2. **I look at one of your recordings** (or you describe it). I'll point out the specific content opportunities hiding in it — the lead magnet angle, the LinkedIn post hooks, the blog post keywords.
3. **We figure out which plan fits.** Starter (1 webinar, 14 pieces, $750/month), Growth (2 webinars, 32+ pieces, $1,000/month), or Scale (4 webinars, 75+ pieces, $1,500/month). Or none — if it's not a fit, I'll tell you.

No contract. Month-to-month. Cancel anytime. First content delivered in 7-10 business days.

**[BOOK YOUR FREE STRATEGY CALL](https://cal.com/contentrepurposehub/30min)**

That's it. 20 minutes. You'll leave with a clear picture of what your webinars could become — whether you work with us or not.

ContentRepurposeHub

P.S. If you're not ready for a call but you're leaning toward "Camp B" from my last email — just reply and tell me about your webinars. How many do you have? What topics? I'll give you a quick take on what we could do with them. No call required.
