# Strategy Call Script & Guide
## ContentRepurposeHub

This is your cheat sheet for strategy calls. Don't read it word for word — just follow the flow and be yourself. The structure does the heavy lifting. You just have to listen and ask the right questions.

---

## Before the Call (2 minutes)

- Open your presentation slides
- Have this script nearby (second screen or printed)
- If they came from the email sequence, they already know the basics. Don't repeat it. Build on it.
- Remember: you're figuring out if you can help them. That's it. If you can, great. If not, tell them.

---

## Part 1: Set the Stage (1 minute)

### What to say:

"Hey [Name], good to meet you. So here's how I like to do these — I'll ask you some questions about your content situation, and then if I see a clear way to help, I'll show you how. If I don't think we're a good fit, I'll tell you that straight up. Should take about 20 minutes. Sound good?"

### Why this matters:

You just told them three things: you're in charge, you're honest, and you won't waste their time. Most salespeople start by asking "so tell me about yourself" and then the prospect rambles for 10 minutes. You're not doing that.

Wait for them to say "yeah, sounds good." That's them agreeing to let you lead. Now you can.

---

## Part 2: Clear the Air (1 minute)

### What to say:

"Before we get into it — I know you've probably talked to people who promised the world and didn't deliver. And you might be thinking 'here comes another sales pitch.' I get it. I'd feel the same way. So let's just have a normal conversation and see if this makes sense."

### Why this matters:

They're thinking this anyway. By saying it out loud, you take the power out of it. They'll almost always relax: "No no, I'm just exploring." Good. Now the wall is down and you can actually talk.

---

## Part 3: Learn About Them (5 minutes)

### Open with:

"Cool. So tell me — what's going on with your content right now? What made you book this call?"

Let them talk. Take notes. Write down their exact words — you'll use them later.

### Then pick 3-4 of these questions (not all):

**About their webinars:**
- "How often do you do webinars?"
- "What happens to the recordings after?"
- "How many recordings do you have sitting around right now?"

**About their content:**
- "What are you doing for content right now? LinkedIn, blog, email?"
- "How many hours a week do you spend on content?"
- "What's working? What's not?"

**About their business:**
- "What do you charge your clients?" (You need this number later)
- "Where do most of your clients find you right now?"

### How to listen:

When they say something painful, don't just nod and move on. Reflect it back:

- They say: "My webinars just sit in a folder."
  You say: "So they just sit there? What happens then?" (They'll keep talking.)

- They say: "I spend all weekend on content."
  You say: "It sounds like content is eating up time you don't have." (Pause. Let them feel it.)

- They say: "I post but nothing happens."
  You say: "Nothing happens... like no engagement? No leads? What does that look like for you?"

The goal is to get them talking about their problems in their own words. You're not diagnosing yet. You're listening.

### What you're figuring out:

| What They Say | What It Tells You | Where They'll Land |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| "I don't have time for content" | Time problem | Starter or Growth |
| "My webinars just sit in a folder" | They know they're wasting content | Starter |
| "I post but nothing happens" | Strategy problem | Growth |
| "I want to be found on Google/AI" | They understand search | Growth or Scale |
| "I need more leads" | Revenue problem | Growth or Scale |
| "I have a bunch of old recordings" | Sitting on a goldmine | Scale |

---

## Part 4: Help Them See the Gap (4 minutes)

### This is the most important part. And you do it by asking, not telling.

The old script told you to present the math to them. That's backwards. When YOU tell someone "you're wasting $4,500 a month," they can shrug it off. When THEY say it, they can't unhear it.

### The time question:

"You said you spend about [X hours] a week on content. At [$their rate] an hour, what does that add up to per month?"

Let them do the math. Wait. Don't fill the silence.

They'll say something like "$3,000" or "$4,500." Let that number hang in the air for a second.

Then: "And that's time you could be spending coaching clients, right?"

### The waste question:

"You said you have [X] recordings sitting in a folder. If each one could turn into 14 or more content pieces, how many pieces is that just sitting there?"

Let them multiply. They'll say "that's like 70 pieces" or whatever the number is.

Then: "And right now, none of that is out there working for you."

Pause.

### The future question:

"What happens if nothing changes? If 6 months from now you're still creating content from scratch every week — what does that look like?"

This one is important. Let them paint the picture. They'll say something like "I'll still be stuck" or "I'll keep burning time." That's them telling themselves why they need to change.

### The flip side:

"And if someone handled all of that — turned every webinar into a month of content, optimized for Google and AI search — what would you do with those [X hours] back?"

Let them answer. They'll say something like "I'd coach more clients" or "I'd actually take weekends off." Write down what they say. You'll use it in the recommendation.

### Then check you got it right:

"Let me make sure I understand. You're doing about [X] webinars a month. The recordings sit in a folder after. You spend about [X hours] a week making content from scratch — that's about [$X/month] in your time. And you're not showing up when people search for [their niche] on Google or AI. Did I get that right?"

Wait for them to say: **"Yeah, that's exactly it"** or **"That's right."**

That moment is gold. They just confirmed the problem in their own words. Now your recommendation isn't a sales pitch — it's the obvious next step.

---

## Part 5: Show What You'd Do (3 minutes)

### Start with the process — this is what makes you different.

"So here's what we'd do with that webinar you did about [topic they mentioned]. And I want to explain the process, because we don't just chop it into clips. There's a strategy behind it.

**First, we capture your voice.** Before we create anything, we study how you speak — your phrases, your rhythm, the way you explain things. So every piece sounds like you wrote it. Not a freelancer. Not AI. You.

**Then we find your strongest angles.** Your webinar has a lot of ideas in it. Some are good, a few are great. We figure out which ones your audience will respond to most and build content around those first.

**We also research what your audience actually searches.** So the blog post isn't just a cleaned-up transcript — it targets the exact keywords your ideal clients are typing into Google.

**And we build each piece for the platform it lives on.** A LinkedIn post follows LinkedIn patterns. An email sequence follows proven conversion frameworks. A lead magnet is designed to capture emails, not just summarize your slides."

### Then show the specific deliverables:

"So from that one webinar about [their topic], you'd get back:

- A lead magnet about [specific angle from their topic]
- 10 LinkedIn posts that position you as the go-to person for [their thing]
- A blog post targeting people who search for '[something in their niche]'
- A newsletter for your existing list
- A landing page for the lead magnet

14 pieces. All in your voice. All optimized for search. Delivered in 7-10 business days."

### The AI search part (use this — it's your differentiator):

"Here's something worth knowing. More and more people are asking ChatGPT or Perplexity things like 'who's a good coach for [their niche].' If your content isn't set up for that, you're invisible to all those people. We structure everything so AI assistants can find and cite you. Nobody else doing webinar repurposing does this."

---

## Part 6: Recommend a Plan (3 minutes)

### Pick ONE plan. Don't show all three and ask them to choose.

Use their own words from Part 3 and Part 4:

**If they do ~1 webinar/month and want to test:**

"Based on what you told me — [mirror their situation] — I'd say start with Starter. One webinar a month, 14 content pieces, $750. You see the quality, see how it works, and go from there."

**If they do 2+ webinars or mentioned lead generation:**

"From what you shared about [their goals], Growth makes the most sense. Two webinars a month, 32+ pieces, and it includes email sequences that turn your subscribers into clients. $1,000 a month. That's where most coaches end up."

**If they have a backlog or want to go big:**

"You've got [X] recordings sitting there. Scale would turn 4 of those into 75+ content pieces every month. Full content machine — LinkedIn, blog, email, Instagram, YouTube. $1,500 a month. In 3 months you'd have a library driving traffic and leads on its own."

### Then show the math:

"At [$750/$1,000/$1,500] for [14/32/75] pieces, that works out to [$54/$31/$20] per piece. A freelance writer charges $200-$500 for one blog post — without any search optimization."

### Then connect it to their number:

"You said you spend about [$X/month] in time on content. This costs [$plan price]. You'd actually save money AND get better content."

### Then remove the risk:

"And here's the thing — first month is a test run. You send us one webinar, we send back the content. If it doesn't sound like you, if the quality isn't there, you cancel. No contract, no penalty, you keep everything we made. I'd rather you try it and see for yourself than wonder about it for months."

---

## Part 7: Ask for the Decision (3 minutes)

### Say this:

"So that's what I'd recommend. [Plan name], [$price] a month. First delivery in 7-10 business days."

Then:

"Does that feel right for where you are?"

**Then stop talking.** Seriously. Don't add "but no pressure" or "take your time." Just wait. Let them respond.

---

### If They Say Different Things:

**"Yeah, let's do it."**

"Great. Here's what happens next — I'll send you an onboarding form right after this call. Takes about 5 minutes. You upload your first webinar recording, and we'll have your content back in 7-10 business days."

---

**"Sounds good, but I need to think about it."**

Don't say "no problem, take your time." That's how you lose the sale.

Instead:

"Totally fair. It sounds like something specific is on your mind — what is it?"

Then listen. The real reason is hiding behind "I need to think about it." Once they tell you what it actually is, you can address it:

| What's Really Going On | What to Say |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **It's the money** | "I hear you. You said you're spending about [$X] a month in time on content. This is [$plan price]. So you'd actually be spending less AND getting optimized content. It's not a new expense — it replaces a bigger one." |
| **Not sure it'll work** | "That makes sense. Here's what I'd say — try one month. Send us one webinar. See what comes back. If it's not what you expected, cancel. No contract. But at least you'll know instead of wondering." |
| **Need to check with partner** | "Makes sense. What would they need to know to feel good about it? I can send you a summary with the numbers so you have something real to show them." |
| **Bad timing** | "When would be better? Here's the thing though — every month those webinars sit in a folder, that's content not driving traffic. And search rankings compound over time, so the earlier you start, the bigger the head start." |

---

**"That's more than I expected."**

Don't lower your price. Stay calm and get curious:

"More than you expected?"

(Pause. Let them explain what they were thinking.)

"I hear you. What were you comparing it to?"

(They'll mention something — a freelancer, a tool, doing it themselves.)

Then: "So a freelance writer charges $200-$500 for one piece. With Starter you get 14 pieces for $750 — that's $54 each, with search optimization included. You'd pay $3,000-$7,000 for the same thing from freelancers. Without the optimization."

If they genuinely can't afford it:

"If $750 is a stretch right now, no worries. Use the checklist, do it yourself for a while. When your business gets to the point where your time is worth more coaching than creating content, come back. I'll be here."

Don't chase people who can't afford it. It never ends well.

---

**"Can I see samples first?"**

"Of course. I'll send you sample LinkedIn posts, a blog post, and a lead magnet so you can see the quality and style. What format would be most useful to see?"

Follow up within 1 hour with samples + a link to book another call if they want to continue.

---

**"What about [competitor]?"**

If they mention a tool (Repurpose.io, Descript, Opus Clip):

"Those are great tools if you have 15-20 hours a month to do the work. They help distribute or edit, but they don't create the content. You still write every LinkedIn post, blog article, and email yourself. We handle all of it."

If they mention a service (Chopcast, Perennial Content):

"They're solid for general content. The difference is we're built specifically for webinars, our pricing is clear ($750-$1,500 vs their $1,000-$5,000), and we optimize for AI search — which none of them do."

If they mention doing it with ChatGPT:

"You can definitely use ChatGPT to help. It's good for first drafts. But there's a difference between pasting a transcript and getting generic output, versus having someone who knows content strategy pull out the best moments and optimize for search. The checklist shows you what's possible. We handle the execution."

**If they said "let me think about it":**

Subject: Quick summary from our call

Hey [Name],

Good talking today. Here's the recap:

**Your situation:** [1-2 sentences using their own words from the call]

**What I recommended:** [Plan name] at [$price/month] — [X] content pieces from each webinar, delivered in 7-10 days.

**The math:** You're spending about [$X/month] in time on content. The service costs [$price] and gives you back [X hours] per month for coaching.

**Next step:** When you're ready, here's the link: [ONBOARDING LINK]

No rush. But every month those webinars sit unused, that's [X] pieces not working for you.

**If they haven't replied after 48 hours, send this:**

Subject: Have you decided against it?

Hey [Name],

Have you decided against the content repurposing? Either way is totally fine — I just don't want to keep following up if you've already moved on.

[Your name]

(This works because people don't like saying "I decided against it." They'll usually reply "No I haven't decided against it, I've just been busy" — which reopens the conversation.)

---

**If they said no / not a fit:**

Subject: Thanks for chatting

Hey [Name],

Thanks for taking the time today. Based on what you shared, [reason — "it sounds like you want to try the DIY route first" / "the timing isn't right" / etc.].

The checklist is yours — use it whenever you're ready.

If things change down the road, you know where to find me.

## Red Flags — Not a Good Fit

- They don't do webinars and don't plan to start
- They want content made from scratch (not repurposing)
- They're shopping purely on price
- They want guaranteed lead/client numbers
- Something feels off

**What to say:** "Honestly, based on what you're describing, I don't think we're the right fit. [Suggest something else if you can.] But if you start doing webinars later, reach out."

Turning away bad fits builds trust and saves you headaches.

---

## Reminders for Yourself

- Listen more than you talk. Their words are your best tool.
- Don't present three plans. Pick one for them.
- Use their numbers, not yours. "YOU spend $4,500/month" is way more powerful than "coaches spend $4,500/month."
- When they say something painful, reflect it back. Don't just nod and move on.
- After you ask a question or say the price — shut up. Let them fill the silence.
- If they say "let me think about it" — find out WHAT they're thinking about. That's not a no, it's an unresolved question.
- If they say no, respect it. Good clients don't come from pressure.
- The goal isn't to close everyone. It's to help the right people say yes.
