# Strategy Call Script & Guide
## ContentRepurposeHub

Use this as a reference during your 20-minute strategy calls. Don't read it word for word. Be natural. Have a conversation. But follow the structure — it's designed to move someone from "interested" to "ready to start."

---

## Before the Call (2 minutes)

- Open the presentation slides on your screen
- Have this script nearby (second screen or printed)
- Check if they came from the email sequence — if yes, they've already seen the math and the breakdown. Don't repeat it. Build on it.
- Take a breath. You're here to solve their problem, not to sell.

## Part 1: Opening (2 minutes)

### What to say:

"Hey [Name], thanks for booking this. Before I get into anything, I'd love to hear from you — what's going on with your content right now? What made you book this call?"

### Why this works:

They tell you their pain. You don't have to guess. And you'll use their exact words later when recommending a plan.

### Listen for their core problem:

| What They Say | What It Really Means | Plan Direction |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
| "I don't have time for content" | Time problem. They need someone to handle it. | Starter or Growth |
| "My webinars just sit in a folder" | Awareness problem. They know they're wasting content. | Starter |
| "I post but nothing happens" | Strategy problem. Content isn't optimized. | Growth (includes SEO + email) |
| "I want to be found on Google/AI" | Visibility problem. They understand search matters. | Growth or Scale |
| "I need more leads" | Revenue problem. Connect content to pipeline. | Growth or Scale |
| "I have a bunch of old recordings" | Backlog problem. Sitting on a goldmine. | Scale |

**Write down their exact words.** You'll mirror them back in Part 5.

---

## Part 2: Discovery (5 minutes)

### Questions to ask (pick 4-5, not all):

**About their webinars:**
- "How often do you run webinars?"
- "What happens to the recordings after?"
- "How many recordings do you have sitting around right now?"
- "What topics do they cover?"

**About their current content:**
- "What are you doing for content right now — LinkedIn, blog, email?"
- "How many hours per week do you spend on content creation?"
- "What's working? What's not?"

**About their business:**
- "What do you charge clients?" (You need this for the opportunity cost math)
- "Where do most of your clients find you right now?"
- "What would change in your business if you had consistent content going out every week?"

### What you're figuring out:

1. **How many webinars do they have/do?** → Determines which plan
2. **How much time do they spend on content?** → Determines the pain level
3. **What's their hourly rate?** → Determines the opportunity cost math
4. **Are they actually a good fit?** → Not everyone is (see Red Flags below)

---

## Part 3: The Gap (3 minutes)

### This is where you make the problem real.

Use their answers to build the gap:

**The time math:**

"So you said you're spending about [X hours] a week on content. At [their hourly rate], that's [X × rate] per month you're spending on content instead of coaching. That's [annual number] a year."

Pause. Let that number land.

**The waste math:**

"And you said you have [X] webinar recordings. Each one has enough material for at least 14 content pieces. That's [X × 14] pieces of content sitting unused in a folder right now."

Pause again.

**The future cost:**

"Every month you don't repurpose those webinars, you're creating content from scratch that could have come from recordings you already made. And every month those blog posts aren't published, you're missing out on Google traffic and AI search visibility that compounds over time."

### The key line:

"The question isn't whether webinar repurposing makes sense — you already know it does. You downloaded the checklist. The question is whether you want to spend 15-20 hours doing it yourself, or have someone handle it so you can focus on [whatever they said their business priority is]."

---

## Part 4: The Solution (3 minutes)

### Keep it simple and specific to THEM.

Don't explain the general service. Explain what THEIR webinar would become.

"Here's what would happen. You'd send us that webinar you did on [topic they mentioned]. We'd watch it, pull out the key frameworks, the stories, the insights. Then we'd turn it into:

- A lead magnet about [specific angle from their webinar topic]
- 10 LinkedIn posts that position you as the authority on [their topic]
- A blog post targeting people who search '[relevant keyword for their niche]'
- A newsletter edition for your existing list
- A landing page for the lead magnet

All in your voice. Using your actual words from the recording. Optimized for Google and AI search engines."

### The AI search angle (use if they mentioned visibility):

"Here's something worth knowing. When someone asks ChatGPT 'Who's the best coach for [their niche]?' your content needs to show up. We structure everything so it gets cited by AI assistants — not just Google. Nobody else in this space does that."

---

## Part 5: The Recommendation (3 minutes)

### Recommend ONE plan. Don't present all three and ask them to choose.

Use their words from Part 1 and Part 2:

**If they do ~1 webinar/month and want to test:**

"Based on what you shared — [mirror their situation back] — I'd recommend starting with Starter. One webinar per month, 14 content pieces, $750. You can see the quality, see how it works, and upgrade later if you want more."

**If they do 2+ webinars or mentioned lead generation:**

"Based on what you told me about [their goals], Growth makes the most sense. Two webinars per month, 32+ pieces, and it includes an email sequence that turns your subscribers into clients. $1,000 a month. That's where most coaches land."

**If they have a backlog or want to go big:**

"You've got [X] recordings sitting there. Scale would let you turn 4 of those into 75+ content pieces every month. Full content engine — LinkedIn, blog, email, Instagram, YouTube. $1,500 a month. Within 3 months, you'd have a library that's driving traffic and leads on autopilot."

### Then show the cost-per-piece:

"At [$750/$1,000/$1,500] for [14/32/75] pieces, that's [$54/$31/$20] per content piece. A freelance writer charges $200-$500 for one piece — without SEO or AI optimization."

### Then show the comparison to their current cost:

"You said you spend [X hours] on content at [$rate/hour]. That's [$total] a month. This service costs [$plan price]. You'd save [$difference] a month AND get better content."

---

## Part 6: The Close (4 minutes)

### Don't ask "What do you think?" Ask a decision question.

**The transition:**

"So that's what I'd recommend. [Plan name], [$price] a month. First delivery in 7-10 business days. Month-to-month, cancel anytime."

**The ask:**

"Does that feel like the right fit for where you are right now?"

Then **be quiet.** Let them respond.

---

### Handling Responses:

**"Yes, let's do it."**

"Great. Here's what happens next. I'll send you an onboarding form — takes about 5 minutes. You upload your first webinar recording, and we'll have your content back in 7-10 business days. I'll send the form right after this call."

**"That sounds good, but I need to think about it."**

Don't say "No problem, take your time." That loses the sale.

Instead, find out what's actually holding them back:

"Totally fair. Can I ask — what specifically do you want to think through? Is it the investment, the timing, or something else?"

Then address whatever they say:

| What They're Thinking | What to Say |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **The price** | "I get it. Let me put it in context. You said you spend [X hours × $rate] = [$total] on content monthly. This service is [$price]. You're actually saving [$difference] AND getting optimized content. It's not an expense — it's replacing a bigger expense." |
| **Whether it'll work** | "Here's what I'd suggest. Start with one month. Send us one webinar. See the quality of what comes back. If it's not what you expected, cancel. No contract, no risk. But you'll know for sure instead of wondering." |
| **They need to ask a partner/spouse** | "Makes sense. What would they need to know to feel good about it? I can send you a summary with the numbers so you have something concrete to share." |
| **Bad timing** | "When would be better timing? Because here's the thing — every month those webinars sit in a folder, you're missing organic traffic that compounds. The best time to start was 6 months ago. The second best time is now." |

**"That's more than I expected."**

Don't discount. Reframe the value.

"What were you expecting? ... I hear you. Let me show you the comparison. A freelance writer charges $200-$500 per piece. At our Starter plan, you're getting 14 pieces for $750 — that's $54 each, with SEO and AI optimization included. You'd pay $2,800-$7,000 for the same volume from freelancers. Without the optimization."

If they genuinely can't afford it:

"If $750 is a stretch right now, here's what I'd suggest — focus on DIY for now. Use the checklist. When your business gets to the point where your time is better spent coaching than creating content, come back. The service will be here."

Don't chase bad-fit clients. It always ends badly.

**"Can I see samples first?"**

"Absolutely. I'll send you examples of LinkedIn posts, a blog post, and a lead magnet we've created. What format would be most useful to see?"

Then follow up within 1 hour with samples + a booking link to continue the conversation.

**"What if a competitor comes up?"**

If they mention Chopcast, Repurpose.io, or another service:

"Good question. Here's the difference:

[If they mention a tool — Repurpose.io, Descript, Opus Clip]:
'Those are great tools if you have 15-20 hours per month to do the work yourself. They help with distribution or editing, but they don't create the content. You still need to write every LinkedIn post, blog article, and email. We handle all of it.'

[If they mention another service — Chopcast, Perennial Content]:
'They're solid for general content repurposing. The difference is we're specifically built for webinars, our pricing is transparent ($750-$1,500 vs their $1,000-$5,000), and we include AI search optimization — which none of them do. When someone asks ChatGPT for a recommendation in your niche, your content shows up.'

[If they mention doing it with ChatGPT]:
'You can absolutely use ChatGPT to help. It's great for first drafts. But there's a difference between pasting a transcript into ChatGPT and getting a generic output, versus having someone who understands content strategy extract the best moments, optimize for search, and create pieces that actually rank. The checklist shows you what's possible. The service handles the execution.'"

## Red Flags — Not a Good Fit

- They don't do webinars and don't plan to start
- They want content created from scratch (not repurposing)
- They're comparison shopping purely on price
- They want guaranteed lead/client numbers you can't promise
- Something feels off in the conversation

**What to say:** "Honestly, based on what you're describing, I don't think we're the right fit for what you need. [Suggest an alternative if you can.] But if you start doing webinars in the future, reach out."

Turning away bad fits builds trust and saves you months of headaches.

---

## Mindset Reminders

- Listen more than you talk. Their words are your best sales tool.
- Don't present three plans and ask them to choose. Recommend one.
- Use their numbers, not yours. "YOU spend $4,500/month" hits harder than "coaches spend $4,500/month."
- The close isn't "Would you like to proceed?" It's "Does this feel like the right fit?"
- If they say no, respect it. Good clients don't come from pressure.
- But if they say "let me think about it," find out WHAT they're thinking about. That's not a no — it's an unresolved objection.
