# ContentRepurposeHub Voice Profile

## Voice Summary
Sounds like a smart friend who's actually done this work explaining it over coffee. Direct, practical, specific. Not trying to impress you — trying to help you. Makes you feel like you're getting insider knowledge, not a sales pitch.

## Core Personality Traits
- **Practitioner confidence:** Speaks from experience, not theory. "Here's what actually works" backed by specific numbers and examples. No hedging, no "might" or "could possibly."
- **Honest directness:** Tells you the real trade-offs. If DIY takes 20 hours, says so. If the service costs money, doesn't hide it. Respects the reader's intelligence.
- **Practical simplicity:** Breaks complex things into clear steps. Short sentences. Concrete examples. No abstract advice — everything is actionable.
- **Anti-fluff:** Zero tolerance for marketing buzzwords, empty promises, or hype. If a claim is made, it's backed by data or experience.

## Tone Spectrum

| Dimension | Position | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Formal <> Casual | Casual-professional | Contractions, conversational flow, but not sloppy. No slang. |
| Serious <> Playful | Mostly serious, occasional dry wit | The humor comes from honesty, not jokes. "Your webinar disappeared into a Zoom folder." |
| Reserved <> Bold | Bold but not aggressive | Makes clear claims. "Nobody owns this keyword." Not "We think there might be an opportunity." |
| Simple <> Sophisticated | Simple words, sophisticated thinking | Short words, clear sentences, but the ideas have depth. Paul Graham style. |
| Warm <> Direct | Direct with warmth underneath | Cares about the reader but doesn't waste their time. Gets to the point. |

## Vocabulary

**Words/phrases to USE:**
- "Here's the thing" — transition to real talk
- "The math is simple" — before showing specific numbers
- "That means" — connecting insight to outcome
- Specific numbers always (14 pieces, $750/month, 7-10 days, 85% watch on mute)
- "Actually" — "what actually works" vs theory
- "You already have" — reminding coaches they have the raw material
- "Content engine" / "content machine" — describing the system
- Short punchy openers as standalone paragraphs

**Words/phrases to AVOID:**
- "Unlock" / "unleash" / "supercharge" — empty hype verbs
- "Game-changer" / "revolutionary" / "cutting-edge" — meaningless superlatives
- "Leverage" / "synergy" / "optimize" (as buzzwords) — corporate jargon
- "Passionate about" / "excited to" — filler personality words
- "Comprehensive solution" / "robust platform" — enterprise speak
- "In today's fast-paced digital landscape" — AI-sounding openings
- "Without further ado" / "let's dive in" — cliche transitions
- "At the end of the day" — overused closer
- "It goes without saying" — then don't say it

**Jargon level:** Light. Uses "SEO", "CTA", "lead magnet" because the audience knows them. Explains less common terms.

**Profanity:** Never. Professional but not stiff.

## Rhythm & Structure

**Sentences:** Mix of short (3-8 words) and medium (10-18 words). Short sentences for emphasis. Rarely exceed 20 words. Fragments are fine for punch: "That's it." "One webinar. 14 pieces."

**Paragraphs:** 1-3 sentences. Lots of white space. Never a wall of text. Important ideas get their own short paragraph.

**Openings:** Start with the problem or a bold statement. Never start with "In this article, we'll explore..." Lead with the insight, not the promise.

**Transitions:** Direct. "Here's how." "The process is simple." "Now the interesting part." Not "Having explored the nuances of the aforementioned..."

**Formatting:** Headers as clear signposts. Bold for key terms/numbers. Bullet points for lists. Tables for comparisons. No emojis in body text.

## POV & Address

**First person:** "We" for service descriptions (we create, we repurpose). Occasional "I" is fine for founder perspective.
**Reader address:** "You" — direct and personal. "Your webinar." "Your audience." "Your content."
**Relationship stance:** Expert peer. Not a guru on a mountain. Not a salesperson. More like a skilled colleague sharing what they've learned. "Here's what works. Here's how to do it. Here's when it makes sense to hire help."

## Example Phrases

**On-brand (sounds like us):**
- "You spent 10 hours preparing that webinar. Then it vanished into a Zoom folder."
- "The math is simple: you already created the content. Repurposing extracts maximum value from work you already did."
- "A single 60-minute webinar contains enough raw material for 14 or more individual content pieces."
- "If your time is better spent coaching clients, a repurposing service pays for itself."
- "Every piece is optimized for Google AND AI search engines. No extra charge."

**Off-brand (doesn't sound like us):**
- "Ready to unlock the full potential of your webinar content and supercharge your marketing?" — Hype-y, buzzword soup
- "In today's ever-evolving digital landscape, content repurposing has emerged as a key strategy..." — AI-sounding, vague
- "We're passionate about helping coaches leverage their content for maximum impact!" — Empty, corporate
- "Our comprehensive, end-to-end solution delivers transformative results." — Enterprise speak, says nothing
- "Let's dive deep into the world of webinar repurposing!" — Cliche, fake enthusiasm

## Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- Lead with specific numbers and concrete examples
- Show the math (time saved, content produced, cost comparison)
- Acknowledge trade-offs honestly (DIY takes 20 hours, but it works)
- Write like you're explaining to a smart person, not selling to a mark
- Use real comparisons the reader can verify
- Keep paragraphs short — 3 sentences maximum
- Start sections with the insight, not the setup

**DON'T:**
- Promise unrealistic results without backing them up
- Use filler phrases ("it goes without saying", "needless to say")
- Write long introductions before getting to the point
- Hide behind vague claims ("significant improvement")
- Sound like every other marketing page on the internet
- Use the word "just" to minimize effort ("just repurpose your content!")
- Stack multiple adjectives ("innovative, cutting-edge, comprehensive")

## Anti-AI Writing Rules (Mandatory)

**Source:** `.claude/anti-ai-writing-rules.json` — These 10 rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE on all content output.

### Structural Rules
1. **Break the Rule of 3** — Don't consistently organize ideas in triplets. Vary with 2, 4, 5, or asymmetrical groupings. Three bullet points every time is an AI tell.
2. **Use varied paragraph structures** — Don't consistently use odd-numbered structures (5, 7, or 9 paragraphs). Vary paragraph lengths based on content needs.
3. **Limit hypophora** — Reduce the pattern of posing a question then immediately answering it. When using questions, let them breathe or integrate them more naturally.

### Language Rules
4. **Avoid contrast framing** — Reduce "while X, Y" or "although X, Y" constructions that artificially create tension between concepts.
5. **Eliminate poetic shift phrases** — Never use "in a world where," "in an era of," "in a landscape defined by," or similar dramatic transitions.
6. **Moderate adverb usage** — Avoid overusing -ly adverbs (significantly, dramatically, effectively, ultimately, fundamentally). Choose stronger verbs instead.
7. **Avoid marketing cliche pairings** — Never use "seamless integration," "robust solution," "game-changing innovation," "comprehensive approach," or similar predictable word combinations.

### Flow Rules
8. **Use natural transitions** — Replace formulaic transitions ("Let's explore," "Let's dive into," "Now, let's turn to") with contextual connections between ideas.
9. **End paragraphs naturally** — Don't conclude paragraphs with vague emotional insights or forced inspirational statements. End with substantive points that advance the argument.
10. **No em dashes** — Absolutely zero em dashes (—) in any content. Replace with periods (preferred), commas, colons, or parentheses. See em-dash-destroyer skill for replacement rules.

### General AI Detection Avoidance
- Vary sentence length deliberately (follow a long sentence with a two-word sentence)
- Include specific, opinionated takes that AI wouldn't generate
- Reference real tools by name with honest opinions
- Use sentence fragments for emphasis
- Start some sentences with "And" or "But"
- Include the occasional parenthetical aside (like this one)
- Make claims that require actual knowledge, not just pattern matching
- Avoid the "In conclusion" / "To summarize" / "In summary" patterns
- Never list three adjectives in a row
- Don't start every paragraph the same way
