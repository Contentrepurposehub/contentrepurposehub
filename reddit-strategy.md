# Reddit Strategy for ContentRepurposeHub

Your target audience (coaches, consultants, course creators) asks questions on Reddit every day. Reddit is also ChatGPT's #2 cited source after Wikipedia — so being active there does double duty: finds clients AND improves your AI search visibility.

This is your practical playbook. Not a skill — a marketing action plan.

## Why Reddit Works for This Business

- Coaches and consultants ask questions in r/coaching, r/Entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness, r/contentmarketing
- People literally post "How do I repurpose my webinar?" and "I spend all weekend on content"
- Reddit has Domain Authority 91/100 — posts rank on Google within hours
- AI models cite Reddit discussions heavily — your comments become AI-visible content
- It's free

## The Timeline

### Weeks 1-2: Pure Participation (No Promotion)

**Goal:** Build karma, learn community norms, look like a real human.

**Join these subreddits:**
- r/Entrepreneur (2M+ members) — coaches and consultants post here
- r/smallbusiness — business owners struggling with marketing
- r/contentmarketing — people asking about content strategy
- r/coaching — your exact target market
- r/onlinebusiness — course creators and coaches
- r/marketing — general marketing discussions
- r/socialmedia — people asking about content creation

**What to do:**
- Read rules for each subreddit (sidebar)
- Comment helpfully on posts about content, marketing, webinars
- Share genuine opinions and insights
- Upvote good content
- Ask questions in your areas of genuine interest
- **Do NOT mention ContentRepurposeHub at all**
- **Goal: Build 50-100+ karma**

**Example helpful comments (no promotion):**

Someone posts: "I do webinars but they just sit in a Zoom folder"
> "I've been researching this a lot. One webinar has enough material for 14+ content pieces if you break it down — blog posts from the main teaching, LinkedIn posts from individual insights, a lead magnet from any framework you mentioned, email content from stories you told. The recording is a rough draft of a month of content. Most people just don't think of it that way."

Someone posts: "How do I create content consistently as a coach?"
> "The biggest shift for me was stopping trying to create from scratch. If you do any kind of teaching — webinars, workshops, even long client calls (with permission) — that's your content. Record it, pull out the good parts, reformat for different platforms. One hour of teaching = weeks of content."

### Weeks 3-4: Value-First Contributions

**Goal:** Build reputation as someone who knows content repurposing.

**What to do:**
- Answer content/marketing questions with detailed, specific advice
- Share insights about webinar repurposing without linking to anything
- Help people solve problems you know how to solve
- Build comment karma through quality responses
- **Still no promotion. Build trust first.**
- **Goal: Build 100-200+ karma**

### Week 5+: Strategic Participation

**Goal:** Naturally mention ContentRepurposeHub when genuinely relevant.

**Rules:**
- Still lead with helpful advice (80% of the comment)
- Only mention your service when directly relevant to the question
- Use disclosure: "Full disclosure: I run a webinar repurposing service"
- Don't link to your homepage — link to a specific helpful blog post if anything
- Mention alternatives too (shows honesty)
- Keep doing non-promotional commenting (most of your activity)

## Comment Strategy

### Finding Opportunities

**Search for these on Reddit:**
```
site:reddit.com "repurpose webinar"
site:reddit.com "webinar content"
site:reddit.com "content from webinar"
site:reddit.com "how to repurpose" coach
site:reddit.com "spend hours on content" coach
site:reddit.com "content creation overwhelmed"
```

**Monitor these keywords in your subreddits:**
- "repurpose"
- "webinar recording"
- "content from scratch"
- "no time for content"
- "content strategy for coaches"

**Tools (free):**
- F5Bot — Set up keyword alerts for Reddit mentions
- Google Alerts — "site:reddit.com" + your keywords
- Reddit search — Sort by "New" to catch fresh questions

### The Good Comment Structure

```
[Genuine helpful advice — 2-3 sentences addressing their actual problem]

[Specific insight from your expertise — 1-2 sentences]

[If directly relevant: mention your service with disclosure]
"Full disclosure: I run a service that does this (ContentRepurposeHub).
But honestly, you can start doing this yourself with the process I described above."

[Offer more help without being pushy]
"Happy to answer any specific questions about the process."
```

### Example Good Comment

Someone asks: "I'm a business coach and I spend 15 hours a week on content. How do I stop this?"

> The biggest time sink is usually creating from scratch every week. If you do any kind of teaching — webinars, workshops, even long coaching calls — you're already creating content. You just need to extract it.
>
> One webinar can realistically give you a blog post, 10+ social posts, a lead magnet, and email content. That's 3-4 weeks of content from something you already did.
>
> The process: transcribe the webinar, identify the strongest teaching moments and frameworks, then reformat each one for the platform it's going to. A LinkedIn post from a key insight. A blog post from the main topic. A PDF checklist from any framework you mentioned.
>
> Full disclosure: I actually run a service that does this for coaches (ContentRepurposeHub). But the process works whether you do it yourself or hire someone. The key insight is to stop treating webinars as one-time events.
>
> Happy to break down the process more if helpful.

### What NOT to Do

- Don't drop links without context
- Don't copy-paste the same comment in multiple threads
- Don't lead with your product
- Don't argue if someone criticizes your approach
- Don't delete downvoted comments (looks suspicious)
- Don't use marketing language ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Don't create fake accounts to upvote yourself

## Post Strategy (After Week 5+)

### Posts That Work

**1. Share a process or learning:**
> Title: "How I think about turning webinars into content (framework for coaches)"
> Body: [Share your actual process. Be specific. Include what works and what doesn't.]

**2. Ask a genuine question:**
> Title: "Coaches who repurpose webinars — what content type gets you the most leads?"
> Body: [Share what you've observed, ask for others' experience.]

**3. Share data or insights:**
> Title: "I analyzed 50 coaching webinars. Here's what content performs best from each."
> Body: [Share real findings. Be useful first.]

### Posts That Get You Banned

- "Check out my new webinar repurposing service!"
- "I built a tool that..." (in a non-relevant subreddit)
- Anything that reads like marketing copy

---

## Tracking What Works

**Weekly check:**
- Upvotes on your comments (are they positive?)
- Reply engagement (do people ask follow-ups?)
- Any DMs or profile visits from Reddit
- Traffic from Reddit in Google Analytics
- Karma growth trend

**Monthly check:**
- Have any of your commented threads ranked on Google?
- Has anyone mentioned ContentRepurposeHub without you?
- Are you getting organic DMs asking about your service?

---

## The AI Citation Bonus

Everything you do on Reddit also builds your AI visibility:

- Your comments in coaching/content threads get indexed
- When someone asks ChatGPT "how to repurpose webinars," Reddit threads with your insights may get cited
- Over time, your brand becomes associated with "webinar repurposing" across multiple sources
- This compounds with your blog posts and website to create a multi-source authority signal

You don't need to optimize for this separately. Just be consistently helpful in the right places, and AI models will naturally include your content in their training and retrieval.
