                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Chopcast (chopcast.io) was an AI-powered video repurposing tool that let users upload long-form videos and automatically generate short clips, blog posts, and social media content. It gained traction through AppSumo lifetime deals and positioned itself as a budget-friendly way to repurpose video content.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Then, starting around early 2025, things went quiet. Users started reporting problems that never got fixed:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
                  <li><strong>Login failures since March 2025.</strong> Multiple users report being completely locked out of their accounts with no way to access their content or projects.</li>
                  <li><strong>Zero response from support.</strong> Users have waited 4-5+ months for replies to support tickets. No acknowledgment, no timeline, no communication.</li>
                  <li><strong>No product updates.</strong> The platform has not shipped visible improvements. The roadmap appears stalled.</li>
                  <li><strong>AppSumo rating: 3.53 out of 5.</strong> Based on 47 reviews, which is notably low for AppSumo listings where most products cluster between 4.0 and 4.8.</li>
                  <li><strong>Persistent bugs.</strong> Users reported slow processing times, weak AI clip detection, inaccurate auto-generated captions, and frequent errors, even before the login issues began.</li>
                  <li><strong>Trustpilot and Product Hunt complaints.</strong> Reviews describe the product as non-functional, with some calling it a waste of money and warning others not to purchase.</li>
                </ul>

                    We are not here to pile on. Products fail for many reasons: funding, team changes, technical debt. But if you are a coach or consultant who depended on Chopcast for your content workflow, you need a working solution now, not a product that may or may not come back.

                  If you are searching for &quot;chopcast alternative&quot; or &quot;chopcast not working,&quot; you are probably in one of two situations: either you were a paying customer who can no longer access the tool, or you were considering Chopcast and found the warning signs during research. Either way, here is what to know.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Chopcast was fundamentally a clip editor. You uploaded a video, the AI tried to find interesting moments, and it generated short clips. That is one small piece of the repurposing puzzle.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  But if you are a coach running webinars, clips are maybe 10% of what you need. Your actual content needs look more like this:
                </p>

                  A clip editing tool solves one of those eight needs. When that tool also stops working, you are left with zero of eight. The coaches who build real audience growth from webinars are not looking for a slightly better clip editor. They need a complete repurposing system, or someone to run that system for them.

                  <li><strong>You still do all the work.</strong> The tool generates raw clips and rough text. You spend hours selecting the best clips, rewriting the AI-generated captions (they are never publish-ready), formatting posts for each platform, and scheduling everything.</li>
                  <li><strong>AI clip detection is unreliable.</strong> Chopcast users consistently reported that the AI picked the wrong moments: cutting mid-sentence, missing key insights, selecting filler content. You end up reviewing every clip manually anyway.</li>
                  <li><strong>No SEO optimization.</strong> Clip tools do not write blog posts optimized for Google rankings. They do not create structured data for AI search citation. They do not build internal linking strategies.</li>
                  <li><strong>No email sequences or lead magnets.</strong> These are the content pieces that actually convert webinar viewers into clients. A clip editor does not touch them.</li>
                  <li><strong>Tool risk.</strong> Chopcast is the proof. When a tool shuts down or stops working, your entire workflow breaks overnight. Your content pipeline goes to zero.</li>

                  <li><strong>Human judgment on content selection.</strong> A person who understands your audience picks the best insights, stories, and frameworks, not an algorithm guessing at engagement signals.</li>
                  <li><strong>Full-stack repurposing.</strong> Blog posts, LinkedIn posts, email sequences, lead magnets, video clips, newsletters, Twitter threads. All from one recording. Not just clips.</li>
                  <li><strong>SEO and AI search optimization built in.</strong> Every blog post and landing page is structured for Google rankings and AI citation in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini.</li>
                  <li><strong>No tool dependency.</strong> The service works regardless of which tools are trending, shutting down, or pivoting. You are hiring an outcome, not subscribing to software.</li>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  The pricing difference is real. Chopcast was $29-$99/month. ContentRepurposeHub starts at $750/month. But the comparison is not apples to apples. Chopcast gave you a tool and left you to do all the work. ContentRepurposeHub gives you finished content: 14-75+ pieces, written in your voice, optimized for search, ready to publish. The actual cost comparison is: $29/month + 15 hours of your time vs. $750/month + 30 minutes of your time.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  If your time is worth $100/hour or more (and as a coach, it almost certainly is), the DIY approach costs $1,500-$2,000/month in opportunity cost alone. The done-for-you service is cheaper.

                  Not everyone who used Chopcast needs the same replacement. Here is how to decide what makes sense for your situation.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Switch to a done-for-you service if:</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li><strong>You run webinars regularly</strong> (monthly or more) and want to turn each one into a full month of content without doing the work yourself.</li>
                  <li><strong>You need more than video clips.</strong> Blog posts, email sequences, lead magnets, and LinkedIn content are where the real business impact comes from, not just short clips.</li>
                  <li><strong>You value your time at $100+/hour.</strong> The math favors a service over spending 10-15 hours per webinar in a DIY tool.</li>
                  <li><strong>SEO matters to you.</strong> You want your webinar content to rank on Google and get cited by AI search engines, not just exist as social media clips.</li>
                  <li><strong>You are done with tool risk.</strong> Chopcast is the second or third tool that has let you down. You want a reliable partner, not another software subscription that might disappear.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Consider another DIY tool if:</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
                  <li><strong>You genuinely enjoy the editing process</strong> and have 10-15 hours per week to dedicate to content creation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Your budget is strictly under $200/month</strong> and you cannot invest in a service right now.</li>
                  <li><strong>You only need video clips</strong>, with no blog posts, no emails, no lead magnets, no SEO.</li>
                </ul>

                  Losing a tool you relied on is frustrating. But it is also a chance to ask whether a DIY clip editor was ever the right solution for your business. Most coaches who leave tool-based repurposing for a done-for-you service say the same thing: &quot;I should have done this sooner.&quot;

                  You already have the content. You already run webinars. The gap is not creating more raw material. It is turning what you already have into a content engine that generates leads, builds authority, and grows your audience across every platform.
