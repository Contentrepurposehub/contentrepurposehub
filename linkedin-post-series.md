# LinkedIn Post Series -- ContentRepurposeHub

## Suggested Posting Schedule

Post **3x per week** (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday -- highest LinkedIn engagement days).

| Week | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday |
|------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Week 1 | Post 1 (Value) | Post 6 (Insight) | Post 11 (Engagement) |
| Week 2 | Post 2 (Value) | Post 7 (Insight) | Post 12 (Engagement) |
| Week 3 | Post 3 (Value) | Post 8 (Insight) | Post 13 (Engagement) |
| Week 4 | Post 4 (Value) | Post 9 (Insight) | Post 14 (Engagement) |
| Week 5 | Post 5 (Value) | Post 10 (Insight) | Post 15 (Engagement) |

This alternating pattern (value, then opinion, then engagement) keeps the feed varied and avoids three "teaching" posts in a row. Five weeks of content from one batch of writing.

### Post 1: The Math of What One Webinar Contains

One 45-minute webinar contains more content than most coaches create in a month.

Here is the actual math.

A typical webinar includes:
-- 3-5 major teaching points
-- 8-12 supporting stories or examples
-- A framework or methodology
-- An intro that sets up the problem
-- A Q&A section with real objections

From that single recording, you can extract:

1 long-form blog post (1,500-2,500 words)
10 LinkedIn posts (one per teaching point, story, or insight)
1 lead magnet (turn the framework into a PDF)
1 newsletter edition
1 email welcome sequence

That is 14 content pieces. Minimum.

All from something you already recorded. Already said. Already delivered.

The content exists. It is sitting in a Zoom folder right now.

The question is not "what should I post this week?"

The question is "why am I not using what I already have?"

### Post 2: Why Coaches Spend 15+ Hours a Week on Content

Coaches spending 15+ hours a week on content creation are solving the wrong problem.

Here is what I see over and over:

Monday: Stare at blank screen. What should I post?
Tuesday: Write a LinkedIn post from scratch. Takes 90 minutes.
Wednesday: Brainstorm newsletter topic. Research. Draft. Edit.
Thursday: Try to write a blog post. Give up halfway.
Friday: Scramble to post something. Anything.

That is 15+ hours. Every week. For maybe 3-4 pieces of content.

Meanwhile, the same coach ran a webinar last month where they taught for 60 minutes straight. Fluidly. With stories, frameworks, and insights.

That recording is the raw material for a month of content.

The problem is not a lack of ideas. The problem is starting from zero every single time.

The coaches who post consistently are not better writers. They have a better system.

What does your content creation process look like right now?

### Post 3: Turning a Webinar into a Blog Post (The Actual Process)

Turning a webinar into a blog post is not just transcribing and cleaning up the text.

That gives you a mess.

Here is the process I have been refining:

Step 1: Watch the webinar. Identify the 1 core argument. Not 3. Not 5. One.

Step 2: Pull the supporting points. Most webinars have 3-5 that back up the core idea.

Step 3: Restructure for reading. Webinars meander. Blog posts cannot. Reorder for logic, not chronology.

Step 4: Add what was implied. In a webinar, you gesture. You say "you know what I mean." A blog post needs those gaps filled in.

Step 5: Optimize for search. Add the keywords your audience is actually searching. Structure headers so Google and AI search engines can parse them.

Step 6: Cut 40% of the words. Speaking is loose. Writing is tight.

The result is a 1,500-2,500 word article that sounds like you, ranks on Google, and did not take you 6 hours to write from scratch.

Have you ever tried to repurpose a webinar into written content? What tripped you up?

### Post 4: The Most Underused Asset Coaches Have

Most coaches are sitting on a gold mine of content and do not realize it.

It is their webinar recordings.

Think about it. Every time you run a webinar, you are:

-- Teaching your best frameworks
-- Telling your most compelling stories
-- Answering real questions from real people
-- Demonstrating your expertise for 30-60 minutes straight

Then the replay link expires and that recording collects dust.

I have been studying how coaches create content. The ones who seem to "always be posting" are not writing 15 original pieces a week. They are extracting content from longer-form things they already did.

Webinars are the best source because the content is already in your voice, already structured around your methodology, and already addresses what your audience cares about.

You do not need more ideas. You need a system for using the ideas you already delivered.

How many webinar recordings are sitting in your Zoom or Google Drive right now?

### Post 5: Content Repurposing for AI Search (Not Just Google)

Here is something most content strategies are missing right now.

Google is not the only search engine that matters anymore.

People are asking ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Grok for recommendations. "Who is a good business coach?" "What is the best way to price consulting services?" "How do I grow my coaching business?"

If your content is not structured to be cited by AI, you are invisible to a growing chunk of your audience.

Here is what I have found matters for AI search:

-- Clear, direct answers to specific questions (AI pulls these as citations)
-- Structured content with proper headings (AI parses this more easily)
-- Entity-rich writing (mention your name, your methodology, your niche by name)
-- Depth over fluff (AI rewards thoroughness, not word count)

The good news: if you are repurposing webinars correctly, your content naturally has depth, specificity, and real expertise built in.

The coaches who figure this out early will have a significant advantage.

Are you thinking about AI search as part of your content strategy yet?

## INSIGHT / OPINION POSTS (Posts 6-10)

### Post 6: Repurposing Is Not Just Chopping Video into Clips

Most "content repurposing" services just chop your video into short clips and call it a strategy.

That is editing. It is not repurposing.

Real repurposing means transforming the ideas in your webinar into content that is native to each platform.

A LinkedIn post is not a transcript snippet. It is a standalone insight restructured for how people read on LinkedIn.

A blog post is not a cleaned-up transcription. It is a rewritten, SEO-optimized article with proper structure.

A lead magnet is not your slides as a PDF. It is your framework turned into something someone would trade their email for.

The difference matters because chopped clips feel repurposed. People can tell. The engagement is low. The content feels like leftovers.

Properly repurposed content feels original on every platform. Because the ideas are original. Only the format changed.

If you are paying someone to just cut your video into clips, you are paying for the lowest-value version of repurposing.

The value is in the transformation. Not the trimming.

### Post 7: Why "Just Use AI to Write Your Content" Does Not Work for Coaches

"Just use ChatGPT to write your posts."

I hear this constantly. And for coaches, it is bad advice.

Here is why.

Your content is your sales process. When a potential client reads your LinkedIn post or your newsletter, they are evaluating whether you think the way they need someone to think.

Generic AI content does not sound like anyone. It sounds like a blender of every coach on the internet. Smooth. Correct. Forgettable.

Your clients are not hiring "a coach." They are hiring you. Your specific POV. Your frameworks. Your stories.

AI is a powerful tool for editing, structuring, and optimizing. But it cannot be the source.

You know what can be the source? The 45 minutes where you taught your methodology on a webinar. In your voice. With your examples. With your actual opinions.

The best use of AI in content is not "write me a post."

It is "help me turn what I already said into something that works on this platform."

The raw material has to be yours.

### Post 8: The Webinar-to-Content Pipeline Coaches Are Sleeping On

There is a pipeline that some of the most consistent content creators use and almost never talk about.

It goes like this:

Run a webinar. Record it. Repurpose it. Repeat.

One webinar per month becomes:
-- Weekly blog posts for the month
-- Daily LinkedIn posts for two weeks
-- A lead magnet to grow your list
-- A newsletter edition
-- An email sequence for new subscribers

That is not hypothetical math. That is what a single 45-60 minute recording contains when you break it down properly.

The reason coaches sleep on this is because it does not feel like "content creation." It feels like something they already did.

Which is exactly the point.

You are not creating from scratch. You are distributing what you already know, in the formats your audience actually consumes.

The webinar is the engine. Everything else is distribution.

Most coaches have the engine. They just never turn it on.

---

### Post 9: Content Does Not Have to Be Created from Scratch Every Week

Somewhere along the way, coaches got the idea that every piece of content needs to be an original creation.

A brand new idea. A blank page. Every single time.

That is not how the most consistent creators operate.

They work from a content core -- one substantial piece of thinking -- and distribute it across formats and platforms.

A keynote becomes a blog post becomes 10 social posts becomes a newsletter becomes a lead magnet.

The ideas do not change. The packaging does.

This is not lazy. It is smart. Your audience is not seeing everything you post. The person who reads your newsletter probably missed your LinkedIn post. The person who downloads your lead magnet probably never saw your blog.

Different people consume content in different places and different formats.

Saying the same thing in multiple ways across multiple platforms is not repetition.

It is reach.

Stop starting from zero every Monday morning.

---

### Post 10: "I Don't Have Time for Content" Means the Wrong System

Every coach I talk to says the same thing.

"I know I need to post more. I just do not have the time."

I get it. Between clients, sales calls, program development, and actually running a business, content falls to the bottom of the list.

But here is what I have noticed:

These same coaches have time to run a 60-minute webinar. They have time to teach a 90-minute workshop. They have time to deliver a training.

That is content. It is already created. It just has not been distributed yet.

The "no time" problem is usually a systems problem.

If your content process is "sit down, think of an idea, write it from scratch, edit, post" -- yeah, that takes forever.

If your content process is "record once, repurpose into 14 pieces" -- now we are talking about distribution, not creation.

You do not need more hours. You need a system that uses the hours you already spent.

What would change in your business if content took 2 hours a month instead of 15 hours a week?

## ENGAGEMENT / QUESTION POSTS (Posts 11-15)

### Post 11: What Happens to Your Webinar Recording After the Replay?

Genuine question for coaches and consultants who run webinars:

What happens to your recording after the replay period ends?

Because here is what I suspect happens for most people:

It goes into a Zoom folder.
Maybe a Google Drive.
Never gets looked at again.

Meanwhile, that recording contains:
-- Your best teaching
-- Your real voice and stories
-- Answers to questions your audience actually asked
-- A framework you spent weeks developing

All sitting unused.

I have been thinking a lot about this gap between "I delivered great content in my webinar" and "I have nothing to post this week."

The content exists. The distribution does not.

So I am curious -- what do you currently do with your webinar recordings after the live event?

Drop it in the comments. I genuinely want to know.

### Post 12: 14 Pieces of Content Without Creating Anything New

Hypothetical for you.

Say you could get 14 pieces of content delivered to you every month -- blog posts, LinkedIn posts, a lead magnet, a newsletter, an email sequence.

And you did not have to write any of it from scratch.

All pulled from a webinar you already recorded.

What would you do with the extra time?

Would you run more sales calls?
Create a new program?
Actually take a weekend off?

I ask because most coaches I talk to spend 10-15 hours a week on content. That is 40-60 hours a month.

If even half of that went away, what becomes possible?

Not a trick question. Genuinely curious what the bottleneck is for you.

Is it the content creation itself, or is content just the most visible symptom of not enough hours in the day?

---

### Post 13: The Gap Between "I Did a Webinar" and "I Have a Content Strategy"

The gap between "I did a webinar" and "I have a content strategy" is smaller than most coaches think.

Here is what I mean.

If you ran a webinar on, say, pricing strategies for consultants, you already have:

-- A blog post: "How to Price Your Consulting Services" (the core teaching)
-- 10 LinkedIn posts (one per major point, story, or insight you shared)
-- A lead magnet: "The Consulting Pricing Checklist" (your framework as a PDF)
-- A newsletter: The Q&A section repackaged as "Questions I Get About Pricing"
-- An email sequence: 3 emails that walk new subscribers through your methodology

You did not plan a content strategy. You taught a webinar.

But the strategy was already in there. It just needs to be extracted and formatted.

The distance between "I have a recording" and "I have a content engine" is not more ideas.

It is a process.

What webinar have you done recently that could become more than just a replay?

---

### Post 14: Coaches Who Create Content Consistently -- What Is Your Process?

Genuinely curious about something.

For coaches and consultants who post content consistently -- multiple times a week, across platforms, without burning out:

What is your actual process?

Do you batch write everything on one day?
Do you repurpose from longer content?
Do you have a team or a system?
Do you write in the moment?

I have been studying content systems for coaches specifically, and I have noticed the most consistent ones almost never start from a blank page.

They have some kind of source material -- a podcast, a workshop, a webinar, a client call framework -- that feeds everything else.

But I would rather hear it from people doing it.

No wrong answers. No judgment if your answer is "I wing it every time."

What is working for you right now?

### Post 15: One Webinar = A Full Content System (Most Coaches Build It from Scratch Instead)

One webinar recording contains:

-- 1 blog post
-- 10 LinkedIn posts
-- 1 lead magnet
-- 1 email sequence
-- 1 newsletter edition

Most coaches create all of that from scratch every month instead.

Here is what that looks like:

The scratch method: 15+ hours per week. Blank pages. "What should I write about?" Inconsistent posting. Burnout by month three.

The repurposing method: Record once. Extract everything. Distribute across platforms. 14+ pieces from one session.

Same output. Fraction of the effort.

The reason more coaches do not do this is not because they disagree with the logic. It is because the extraction process -- turning spoken content into platform-native written content -- takes skill and time.

It is not just copying and pasting a transcript.

It is restructuring ideas for each format. Optimizing for search. Keeping your voice intact.

That is the part I help with. I repurpose webinars into content systems for coaches and consultants.

If you are running webinars and not repurposing them, you are working harder than you need to.

What would your content look like if you never started from a blank page again?
