## Email Body

My grandmother Rose made a decision at 30 years old that I think about almost every day.

It was her birthday. A cold day. She turned to my grandfather and said something that would change the entire destiny of our family:

**"We don't have any money. We're living paycheck to paycheck. I don't want to retire here. I want to go to California where it's warm."**

My grandfather asked what she wanted to do about it.

And she said: "We need to change what we're doing, or nothing will change."

She didn't have a college degree. My grandfather worked in a plant. She worked in retail. They were ordinary people with an ordinary income.

But that day, she started saving 50 cents a week from her paycheck. My grandfather did the same.

50 cents a week.

She didn't wait until they had more money. She didn't wait until the timing was right. She didn't wait until she understood the stock market.

She started with what she had.

Over her lifetime, Grandma Rose became an investor. She became a self-made millionaire. She moved to California. She retired where it was warm.

And her friends from Milwaukee — the ones who teased her for brown-bagging her lunch, for being "cheap," for not spending like everyone else?

They got stuck. They couldn't afford to retire the way she did.

## The Ripple Effect That Still Blows My Mind

Here's the part of this story that I didn't fully understand until I was much older.

Grandma Rose's decision at 30 didn't just change her life.

She taught my father how to invest. He became a financial adviser for 45 years.

My sister became a financial adviser.

I became a financial adviser at Morgan Stanley, then spent the last 30 years writing books and teaching millions of people about money.

**One woman. One decision. On one cold birthday.**

And here I am, decades later, still teaching the lessons she taught me when I was seven years old at a McDonald's — when she explained the difference between consumers, employees, and investors, then took me to a brokerage firm to buy my first share of stock.

That's what I mean when I say financial decisions have a ripple effect. You're not just deciding for yourself. You're deciding for your kids. Your grandkids. Generations you'll never meet.

## Why I'm Telling You This Right Now

I'm not sharing Grandma Rose's story today just because it's a nice story.

I'm sharing it because I believe the next 10 years will be the greatest opportunity to build wealth in our lifetime.

AI is making companies more productive and more profitable than they've ever been. The stock market went up over 17% last year. Some global investments were up 30%+. There are now 24 million millionaires in the United States — up 8 million in just 20 years.

Wealth is being created at a pace we haven't seen before.

**And at the same time, the safety nets are breaking.**

Social Security is projected to be underfunded by 2033 — that's less than 8 years from now. The government is already warning of a 20% cut to benefits. Sixty million Americans depend on that $1,900 monthly check.

I just did a keynote speech in Arizona. I asked the audience how many Americans receive SNAP checks (government food assistance). Most people had no idea. The answer: 41.5 million people. Getting about $6 a day for food.

When the government shut down for six weeks, that was three pay cycles. The average American doesn't have two weeks of expenses saved. Let that sink in.

No one is coming to save you. The system that people are counting on is buckling under its own weight.

## Your Grandma Rose Moment

My grandmother didn't have AI. She didn't have investment apps. She didn't have target-date mutual funds that automatically rebalance. She didn't have index funds that let you own 3,500 companies for the cost of a coffee.

She had 50 cents a week and a decision.

You have more tools, more access, and more opportunity than she ever did.

The question is the same one she answered on that cold birthday:

**Are you going to change what you're doing? Or are you going to keep doing the same thing and hope something magically changes?**

Here's what I know after 33 years of doing this:

Nothing changes until you make it automatic.

Not "I'll start saving next month."
Not "I'll figure out investing when I have more money."
Not "I'll deal with it later."

Automatic. Today. Even if it's $1 a day. Even if it's 1% of your income. Even if you open the account and set up the transfer and start with the smallest amount you can imagine.

Because here's the thing about my grandmother — she didn't start rich. She started with 50 cents. But she started. And she made it automatic. And she never stopped.

## One Action You Can Take Today

Open your phone. Go to whatever brokerage or bank you use — or open a new account at Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard (takes 10 minutes).

Set up an automatic transfer. Whatever you can afford. From your checking account, on payday, every single time.

Don't think about it. Don't budget for it. Don't plan to start next month.

Do it while you're reading this email.

My grandmother always said three things:

1. **"Dream it, design it, and do it."**
2. **"You're going to run out of time."**
3. And the one that started everything: **"We need to change what we're doing, or nothing will change."**

She was right about all three.

P.S. — This might be the last time I do this. I've updated The Automatic Millionaire one final time. New strategies for the AI economy. New fund recommendations. 20 years of reader success stories. The book I wish I could hand to every person who's ever said "I don't know where to start." If that's you, this is where you start.
