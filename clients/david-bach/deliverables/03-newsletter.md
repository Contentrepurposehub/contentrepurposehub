There are now 654,000 people in Fidelity 401k plans who are millionaires.

All-time record. And here's what they all have in common — they didn't earn six figures. They didn't pick winning stocks. They didn't time the market. They followed one formula and they followed it long enough for the math to work.

Here's the formula:

**Save 14% of your gross income** (plus whatever your employer matches).

**Invest 70% stocks / 30% bonds.**

**Automate the transfer** so money moves on payday — before you see it, before you can spend it.

That's it.

Not budgeting. Not discipline. Not "I'll start when I make more money."

A machine.

**The part most people get wrong:**

The average American saves 3-5% of their income. Follow this for one second — that's about 24 minutes of an 8-hour workday going to their future self. Then they wonder why they can't retire.

Meanwhile, the 654,000 who hit millionaire status? They saved the first hour of every workday. 12.5% minimum. Most at 14%. And they set it to move automatically, like taxes.

The government doesn't ask you to budget to pay taxes. They take them automatically, before you see the money. That's why taxes always get paid.

Your wealth system needs to work the same way.

**Here's how to start (even if you're not at 14% yet):**

1. Set your 401k contribution to whatever you can — even 3%
2. Set it to increase by 1% every six months
3. You won't feel the 1% increases — your lifestyle adjusts
4. Within 3-5 years, you'll be at the 14% target
5. The key: it has to be automatic. The money moves on payday.

I recently broke this entire system down in a conversation with Steven Bartlett on the Diary of a CEO — every percentage, every account, every step. Including the stories of real people who used this formula starting from zero (and from debt).

The formula works. The question is whether your system is running.

# Newsletter Edition: The $390,000 Question Nobody's Asking Renters

**Subject Line:** Homeowners are worth 40x more than renters. Here's the math.
**Preview Text:** Average homeowner: $400K net worth. Average renter: $10K. Somebody's getting rich in that transaction.

I'm going to give you a number that should make you uncomfortable.

Homeowners in America are worth **40 times more** than renters.

Not 40% more. 40 *times* more.

Average homeowner net worth: $400,000+.
Average renter net worth: $10,000.

That's a $390,000 gap. And it gets wider every single year.

**"But David, it's an absolute freaking myth that renting is throwing money away."**

Actually — it is an absolute freaking myth that people take the money they save by renting and invest it in the stock market. They don't do that. We know that for a fact. The data is right in front of us. Renters are worth $10,000. If they were investing the difference, that number would be a lot higher.

Here's the reality: every month you rent, somebody IS getting rich in that transaction. If you're the renter, you're not the one.

**The leverage math nobody explains:**

People don't buy houses with cash. They put 20% down and borrow 80%.

So — $200,000 house. $40,000 down payment. The house doubles to $400,000 over 15-20 years. That's $200,000 in profit on a $40,000 investment. A 5x return on your actual money.

And real estate has gone up 400% in the last 20 years. Home equity in America hit $34 trillion — up 90% since before COVID.

Now compare that to renting:

$5,000/month in rent = $600,000 over 10 years. $1.2 million over 20 years. $2 million over 30 years.

Every dollar gone. Zero equity. Zero wealth built.

**The McIntyres proved this formula at $40K/year.**

Jim and Sue McIntyre earned an average of $40,000 a year their entire working lives. Not $400,000. $40,000.

They bought two houses on the same street in San Leandro, California. Paid both off over time. One to live in. One for rental income. Combined that with steady 401k contributions.

At 52, they retired with $1.8 million in net worth.

No inheritance. No stock options. No six-figure salary. Ever.

They got on both escalators — stocks AND real estate — and let the system run.

**There are two escalators to wealth:** stocks and real estate.

$45 trillion in retirement accounts. $34 trillion in home equity. That's nearly $80 trillion sitting in exactly two places.

If you're not on at least one of those escalators, you are being left behind.

I laid out the complete system — both escalators, the exact percentages, and the stories of people who built wealth starting from nothing — in my recent conversation with Steven Bartlett on the Diary of a CEO.
