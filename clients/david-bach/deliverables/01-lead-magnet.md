**Title:** How Automatic Is Your Financial Life?

**Subtitle:** The 2-minute assessment based on the system used by 654,000 401k millionaires

**Intro paragraph:**
Most people think building wealth requires discipline, sacrifice, and a bigger paycheck. It doesn't. It requires a system — one that moves your money automatically, before you ever see it. This scorecard measures how close your financial life is to the exact formula that created 654,000 401k millionaires at Fidelity. Take 2 minutes. Get your score. See what's missing.

## Questions (8 Total)

### Question 1: The First Hour
**"What percentage of your gross income goes to savings or investments BEFORE you spend anything?"**

| Answer | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Less than 3% (or nothing) | 0 |
| 3-5% | 1 |
| 6-10% | 2 |
| 11-14% | 3 |
| 15% or more | 4 |

**Why this matters (shown after answer):** The average American saves 3-5%. That's why the average American retires broke. The 401k millionaire formula starts at 14% of gross income — that's the first hour of every workday going to YOU before anyone else gets paid.

---

### Question 2: Automation Level
**"How does money move into your savings and investment accounts?"**

| Answer | Points |
|--------|--------|
| I manually transfer when I remember to | 0 |
| I transfer manually, but on a regular schedule | 1 |
| Some is automatic (like a 401k), but I manage the rest manually | 2 |
| Everything is automated — money moves the day my paycheck hits | 4 |

**Why this matters:** The government doesn't ask you to budget to pay taxes. They take your taxes automatically. That's why taxes always get paid. Your wealth system needs to work the same way. Not discipline. Not willpower. Automation.

---

### Question 3: Employer Match
**"If your employer offers a 401k match, are you capturing the full match?"**

| Answer | Points |
|--------|--------|
| My employer doesn't offer a match | 1 |
| I'm not enrolled in my 401k | 0 |
| I contribute, but not enough to get the full match | 1 |
| I capture every dollar of the employer match | 4 |

**Why this matters:** An employer match is free money. If your employer matches 4% and you're not contributing at least 4%, you're literally leaving part of your paycheck on the table. The 654,000 Fidelity millionaires? They all captured the full match. Every single one.

---

### Question 4: Investment Allocation
**"How is your retirement money invested?"**

| Answer | Points |
|--------|--------|
| I have no idea / I haven't checked | 0 |
| It's mostly in cash or a money market fund | 1 |
| It's in a target-date fund (set and forget) | 2 |
| I have a specific stock/bond allocation I've chosen | 3 |
| I'm at roughly 70% stocks / 30% bonds (or more aggressive) | 4 |

**Why this matters:** The 401k millionaire formula isn't just about saving — it's about WHERE the money goes. 70% stocks, 30% bonds. That's the allocation. Too many people park their retirement money in cash or conservative funds and wonder why it barely grows. The stock market has gone up 600% in the last 20 years. You need to be on that escalator.

---

### Question 5: The Two Escalators
**"Which wealth-building 'escalators' are you currently on?"**

| Answer | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Neither stocks nor real estate | 0 |
| Stocks only (retirement accounts, brokerage) | 2 |
| Real estate only (I own property) | 2 |
| Both stocks AND real estate | 4 |

**Why this matters:** There are $45 trillion in retirement accounts and $34 trillion in home equity in America. That's $80 trillion — and it's sitting in exactly two places: stocks and real estate. If you're not on at least one of these escalators, you are being left behind. The wealthiest people are on both.

---

### Question 6: Homeownership
**"What's your current housing situation?"**

| Answer | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Renting with no plans to buy | 0 |
| Renting but actively saving for a down payment | 2 |
| I own my home (with a mortgage) | 3 |
| I own my home AND have investment property | 4 |

**Why this matters:** Homeowners in America are worth 40 times more than renters. That's not a typo. Average homeowner net worth: $400,000+. Average renter: $10,000. Every month you pay rent, somebody's getting rich in that transaction. If you're the renter, you're not the one getting rich.

---

### Question 7: The Three Accounts
**"Beyond your day-to-day checking account, which of these do you have funded?"**

| Answer | Points |
|--------|--------|
| None of these | 0 |
| A retirement account (401k, IRA, pension) | 1 |
| A retirement account + an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) | 2 |
| A retirement account + emergency fund + a "dream" account (travel, goals, fun) | 4 |

**Why this matters:** The Automatic Millionaire system runs on three accounts: Retirement (your wealth engine), Security (your emergency fund — so you never raid retirement), and Dream (your life goals, funded automatically). Most people have one, maybe two. Having all three is how you build wealth AND enjoy the journey.

---

### Question 8: The Debt Situation
**"How would you describe your current debt situation?"**

| Answer | Points |
|--------|--------|
| I have high-interest debt (credit cards) and no plan to pay it off | 0 |
| I have debt but I'm making minimum payments | 1 |
| I have a specific plan to eliminate debt within 1-3 years | 2 |
| I have no high-interest debt (mortgage is OK) | 4 |

**Why this matters:** Here's the reality — you can't build wealth while paying 22% interest on credit card debt. The math doesn't work. But here's what most people don't know: you CAN automate your way out of debt using the same system. Set up automatic payments above the minimum, attack the highest interest rate first, and watch the balance drop without relying on willpower.

## Scoring

**Total possible: 32 points**

### Score Ranges

**0-8: Manual Mode (The Willpower Trap)**
- Title: "You're Running on Manual"
- Color: Red

**Results copy:**
Right now, your financial life is running on willpower — and we know for a fact that willpower doesn't work for building wealth. The government doesn't ask you to budget to pay taxes. They take them automatically. That's why taxes always get paid and savings don't.

Here's the good news: you don't need more discipline. You don't need to earn more money. You need one system — and it takes about an hour to set up. The exact formula that created 654,000 401k millionaires starts with automating the first hour of your income. That's 12.5% of what you earn, moved before you see it.

**Your top 3 action items:**
1. Open a retirement account (401k if your employer offers one, IRA if not) and set up automatic contributions at 12.5% of your gross income — or whatever you can start with today
2. If your employer matches, increase your contribution to at least capture the full match — that's free money you're leaving on the table
3. Set every contribution to auto-draft on payday — the money should move before you see it, before you can spend it

---

**9-16: Semi-Automatic (The Foundation Is There)**
- Title: "You've Started — But the System Isn't Complete"
- Color: Yellow/Amber

**Results copy:**
You're ahead of most people — you've got some of the pieces in place. But here's the problem: a half-automatic system still relies on willpower for the other half. And willpower is what fails. Every time.

The 654,000 people who became 401k millionaires didn't just save some money sometimes. They followed one exact formula: 14% of gross income, invested in a 70/30 stock-to-bond allocation, moved automatically on payday. No decisions. No "I'll do it next month." The machine runs.

**Your top 3 action items:**
1. Close the gap between your current savings rate and 14% of gross income — even 1% more per month makes a massive difference over 20 years
2. Check your investment allocation — if you're not at roughly 70% stocks / 30% bonds, you're leaving growth on the table (the stock market has gone up 600% in the last 20 years)
3. Automate everything that isn't already automated — the parts you still manage manually are the parts most likely to slip

**17-24: Mostly Automatic (Fine-Tuning the Machine)**
- Title: "Your System Is Working — Here's How to Accelerate It"
- Color: Light Green

**Results copy:**
You're doing what most Americans never do — you've built a real system. Your money is moving, your investments are growing, and you're on at least one of the two escalators to wealth. That puts you ahead of the 1 in 3 households earning $150K/year who are still broke.

Now it's about optimization. The difference between good and great in wealth-building is the details — the allocation percentages, the tax advantages, the second escalator.

**Your top 3 action items:**
1. If you're only on one escalator (stocks OR real estate), start planning for the second — $34 trillion in home equity and $45 trillion in retirement accounts tell you where wealth actually lives
2. Max out your tax advantages — are you getting the $250K tax-free gain on home sales (single) or $500K (married)? Are you using pre-tax retirement accounts to their limit?
3. Set up your Dream Account — automate a small amount monthly toward your life goals. Wealth isn't just about the number. It's about living.

**25-32: Fully Automatic (The Machine Is Running)**
- Title: "You're Living the Automatic Millionaire Formula"
- Color: Green

**Results copy:**
This is the formula. You're doing what 654,000 Fidelity 401k millionaires do — and you're probably on track to join them. Your money moves automatically. You're on both escalators. Your system runs whether you think about it or not.

Here's what most people don't realize about where you are: you didn't get here through discipline or willpower. You got here through a system. And that system is now compounding in your favor every single day. The next 10 years of your wealth-building will be dramatically bigger than the last 10.

**Your top 3 action items:**
1. Review your allocation annually — as your wealth grows, small optimizations in your stock/bond/real estate mix compound significantly
2. Consider adding rental property income or REITs if you haven't already — the McIntyres built $1.8M on a $40K/year salary by owning two properties plus their 401k
3. Start thinking about generational wealth — estate planning, college funds, family real estate. You've built the machine. Now decide what it builds for.
