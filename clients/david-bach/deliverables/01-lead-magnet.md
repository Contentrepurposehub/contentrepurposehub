## The Automatic Millionaire Scorecard
### How Automatic Is Your Financial Life? Take the 5-Minute Assessment.

**Subtitle:** The system that built 24 million millionaires isn't about discipline. It's about automation. Score yourself to find out if your money is working for you — or disappearing without a trace.

**By David Bach** | Author of The Automatic Millionaire (10 million+ copies sold) | 33 Years in Financial Services | Former Senior VP, Morgan Stanley

### Before You Start

Here's something I learned after 9 years at Morgan Stanley and 33 years helping ordinary people build wealth:

The people who became millionaires on ordinary incomes didn't have more discipline than you. They didn't have a budget. They didn't make a lot of money.

They had one thing: an automatic system.

When I met Jim and Sue McIntyre, they walked into my office at age 52 with a net worth of $1.8 million. Their average income over their lifetime? $40,000 a year. I was making more than double that and was broke.

The difference wasn't income. It wasn't willpower. It was that everything in their financial life was automatic. Money moved before they could spend it. Debt got paid without them thinking about it. Wealth built in the background while they lived their lives.

This scorecard measures one thing: **how automatic is your financial life?**

Your score isn't a judgment of your character. It's a diagnosis of your system. A low score doesn't mean you're bad with money — it means your setup is designed to fail.

The good news? Every gap this scorecard reveals can be fixed in less than 10 minutes.

### How It Works

- 8 categories, 3 questions each (24 questions total)
- Each question: score yourself 0, 1, or 2
- Add up your total at the end
- Your score tells you exactly where to focus first
- Takes about 5 minutes

**Be brutally honest.** This only works if you tell the truth.

---

### Category 1: Pay Yourself First

The government doesn't ask you to budget to pay your taxes. They take the money automatically. They know if they didn't, you'd have nothing left to give. Your savings should work the same way.

**Q1. Do you have an automatic transfer set up to move money into a retirement account (401k, IRA, pension, or equivalent) every time you get paid?**
- 0 = No automatic transfer. I save when I remember to (or I don't save at all).
- 1 = I have something set up, but it's less than 5% of my gross income.
- 2 = Yes. Money moves automatically into my retirement account at 10%+ of my gross income before I can touch it.

**Q2. Does the money move on the SAME DAY your paycheck hits — before you have a chance to spend it?**
- 0 = No. The money sits in my checking account and I transfer it later (if there's anything left).
- 1 = It moves within a few days, but not same-day.
- 2 = Same day. Paycheck arrives, money moves immediately. I never see it.

**Q3. Do you know the exact percentage of your gross income that goes to retirement savings right now?**
- 0 = I have no idea.
- 1 = I have a rough idea, maybe 3-5%.
- 2 = I know the exact number and it's 12% or higher (the Automatic Millionaire target).

**Category 1 Score: ___ / 6**

---

### Category 2: Emergency Protection

Four out of 10 Americans can't get their hands on $1,000 in case of emergency. The Federal Reserve says 37% can't cover a $400 surprise expense. When the government shut down for six weeks, that was three pay cycles — and the average American didn't have two weeks of expenses saved.

**Q4. Do you have a separate emergency savings account (not your regular checking)?**
- 0 = No. Everything is in one account and I just hope nothing bad happens.
- 1 = I have something, but it's less than one month of expenses.
- 2 = Yes. I have a dedicated emergency account with 3+ months of living expenses.

**Q5. Is money automatically deposited into that emergency account every pay period?**
- 0 = No. I add money manually when I think about it (which is rarely).
- 1 = I add money sometimes, but it's not automatic.
- 2 = Yes. Automatic transfer every pay period. I don't have to think about it.

**Q6. If you lost your job tomorrow, how many months could you survive without borrowing money?**
- 0 = Less than one month. I'd be in trouble immediately.
- 1 = 1-2 months if I cut everything.
- 2 = 3+ months. I'd be stressed but not in a financial emergency.

**Category 2 Score: ___ / 6**

---

### Category 3: The Dream Account

You need to put money away for your dreams. That's how they become real. A dream account could be for buying a house, saving for college, taking the vacation you've been talking about for three years, getting married, starting a business. Without a dedicated account, your dreams are just wishes.

**Q7. Do you have a savings account specifically labeled for a goal or dream (house, wedding, vacation, business, education)?**
- 0 = No. I don't have any dedicated savings for future goals.
- 1 = I have something in mind but it's mixed in with my regular savings.
- 2 = Yes. I have a clearly labeled account for a specific dream with a target dollar amount.

**Q8. Is money automatically going into that dream account every month?**
- 0 = No. I'll start saving for it "someday."
- 1 = I put money in when I have extra (which isn't often).
- 2 = Yes. Automatic transfer. The dream is being funded whether I think about it or not.

**Q9. Could you write down right now the exact dollar amount you need for your biggest financial dream and the date you want it by?**
- 0 = No. I haven't thought about it that specifically.
- 1 = I have a vague number but no target date.
- 2 = Yes. I know the exact amount and I know when I want to hit it.

**Category 3 Score: ___ / 6**

---

### Category 4: Debt Elimination

Debt is like quicksand. When I came out of college with $12,000 in credit card debt, it felt like carrying a 50-pound backpack everywhere I went. I remember opening my bills and having the room spin. The way out isn't willpower — it's a system called DOLP (Dead On Last Payment).

**Q10. Do you know exactly how much total debt you have right now (credit cards, loans, everything)?**
- 0 = No. I'm afraid to add it up.
- 1 = I have a rough idea, but I haven't listed it all out recently.
- 2 = Yes. I have every debt listed with the exact balance and interest rate.

**Q11. Are ALL minimum payments on ALL debts set to automatic?**
- 0 = No. I pay manually and sometimes miss payments.
- 1 = Some are automatic, but not all.
- 2 = Every single minimum payment is automatic. I never miss one.

**Q12. Do you have a specific debt payoff strategy (like DOLP) where you're putting extra money toward your smallest balance first?**
- 0 = No strategy. I just pay minimums and hope for the best.
- 1 = I try to pay extra when I can, but there's no system.
- 2 = Yes. I have a written plan, I'm attacking the smallest balance first, and I can see my progress.

**Category 4 Score: ___ / 6**

---

### Category 5: Homeownership Track

Homeowners in America are worth 40 times more than renters. The average homeowner: $400,000 in net worth. The average renter: $10,000. This isn't about buying a mansion. It's about getting on the wealth escalator. Even if you can't buy right now, you should have a plan to get there.

**Q13. Do you currently own a home (or a share of a home)?**
- 0 = No, and I don't have a plan to buy one.
- 1 = No, but I'm actively saving toward a down payment.
- 2 = Yes. I own a home and I'm building equity.

**Q14. If you have a mortgage, are you making any extra payments to pay it off faster (bi-weekly payments, extra annual payment, or 10% added to monthly payment)?**
- 0 = No. Standard 30-year payments only. (Or: I don't have a mortgage.)
- 1 = I've thought about it but haven't set it up.
- 2 = Yes. I have an accelerated payoff strategy in place (bi-weekly, extra payment, or principal add-on).

**Q15. Do you know roughly how much equity you have in your home right now? (Or if renting: do you know how much your rent will cost you over the next 10 years with no equity to show for it?)**
- 0 = No idea.
- 1 = Rough idea.
- 2 = Yes. I know my equity position (or I've calculated my 10-year rent cost and it scared me into action).

**Category 5 Score: ___ / 6**

---

### Category 6: Investment Automation

Your investments should be boring. Your life should be interesting. If someone's at a cocktail party talking about their investments and it's exciting, something's wrong. The 654,000 people in Fidelity 401k plans who are now millionaires didn't pick hot stocks. They invested in index funds automatically, month after month, for decades.

**Q16. Is money automatically invested every month into a diversified investment (index fund, target-date fund, or balanced fund)?**
- 0 = No. I don't invest regularly (or at all).
- 1 = I invest sometimes, but not on a set schedule.
- 2 = Yes. Money goes into investments automatically every month without me doing anything.

**Q17. Do you know what your money is invested in right now? (Could you name the funds or tell someone your stock/bond allocation?)**
- 0 = No clue. I just picked something when I signed up (or I haven't signed up).
- 1 = I have some idea but couldn't explain it to someone.
- 2 = Yes. I know my allocation, I know my funds, and it's roughly 70% stocks / 30% bonds (or age-appropriate).

**Q18. In the last 12 months, have you checked your investments and made sure you're still on track?**
- 0 = I haven't looked in over a year (or ever).
- 1 = I've glanced at it but didn't really review anything.
- 2 = Yes. I've reviewed my accounts, checked my allocation, and confirmed I'm on track.

**Category 6 Score: ___ / 6**

### Category 7: The Subscription & Spending Leak

These phones are designed to get you to spend everything. Today there's better technology than there's ever been to get you to spend more money. And nobody wants you to spend money once — they want you to spend money for a lifetime. That's a lifetime value of a customer. There's a battle for your income, and everyone wants a piece of it.

**Q19. Have you audited your phone subscriptions in the last 90 days? (Settings > Your Name > Subscriptions)**
- 0 = I've never done this. I don't even know where to look.
- 1 = I did it once a while ago, but I'm probably paying for things I forgot about.
- 2 = Yes. I audited recently, cancelled what I don't use, and I check quarterly.

**Q20. Do you know how much you spend per month on subscriptions (apps, streaming, software, memberships)?**
- 0 = No idea. It's probably more than I think.
- 1 = Rough idea, but I've never added it all up.
- 2 = I know the exact number and I've made a conscious decision about each one.

**Q21. Could you find $50-$200 per month in spending you could cut without changing your lifestyle?**
- 0 = I doubt it. I feel like I need everything I'm paying for.
- 1 = Probably, but I haven't looked.
- 2 = I've already done this. I found the waste and redirected that money to saving/investing.

**Category 7 Score: ___ / 6**

---

### Category 8: Protection & Planning

Six out of 10 people don't have a will. 40% of couples can't identify how much their partner earns. If your partner died today, would you know where all the money is, the passwords to every account, and whether there's enough life insurance? I almost died four years ago from meningitis. When I woke up from a four-day coma, I couldn't remember my bank passwords. That experience changed everything about how I think about financial protection.

**Q22. Do you have a will (at any age, especially if you have a partner or children)?**
- 0 = No will.
- 1 = I've been meaning to do one but haven't gotten around to it.
- 2 = Yes. I have a current, signed will.

**Q23. If you're in a relationship: does your partner know where all the money is, the account passwords, and what to do if something happens to you?**
- 0 = No. They'd be completely lost.
- 1 = They know some things, but there are gaps.
- 2 = Yes. We've had the conversation, everything is documented, and we do an annual review.

**Q24. Do you have life insurance (especially if you have dependents)?**
- 0 = No life insurance.
- 1 = I have some through work, but I'm not sure if it's enough.
- 2 = Yes. I have adequate term life insurance to protect my family.

**Category 8 Score: ___ / 6**

### What Your Score Means

**0-12: Code Red — Your Financial Life Is on Manual**
You're flying blind. Money comes in, money goes out, and you don't know where it all went. David calls this a "no plan." The good news? You're exactly who The Automatic Millionaire was written for. Every single fix is in the book, and most can be set up in 10 minutes. You don't need discipline. You need automation. Start with one thing: open your phone, go to your retirement account (or open one at Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard), and set up an automatic transfer of 1% of your income. Just 1%. You won't notice it. Do that today.

**13-24: Yellow Zone — You've Started, But the System Has Holes**
You're doing some things right, but the gaps are where your wealth is leaking. Look at which categories scored lowest — those are your highest-leverage fixes. Most people in this range have a retirement account but aren't contributing enough, have some savings but no automation, and are bleeding money through forgotten subscriptions. The Automatic Millionaire shows you how to close every gap and get the whole system running automatically. Your #1 move: increase your retirement contribution by 1% this month and set up automatic transfers for emergency and dream accounts.

**25-36: Green Zone — Your System Is Working, Time to Optimize**
You're ahead of most Americans. Your finances are mostly automated, you're saving, and you have some protection in place. Now it's about optimization: Are you saving enough? (The millionaire formula is 14% of gross income plus employer match, invested 70/30 stocks/bonds.) Is your mortgage being paid off early? Are you maximizing tax advantages? The Automatic Millionaire's updated edition has new strategies for this exact stage — including which index funds to consider (VTI, QQQ, Vanguard Balanced) and how to build generational wealth.

**37-48: Automatic Millionaire Status — You're Living the System**
You've built what David teaches. Your financial life runs on autopilot. You're paying yourself first, your debt has a payoff plan, your investments are automated, and your family is protected. At this point, your job is to maintain the system, teach it to the next generation, and focus on what money is actually for: health, love, gratitude, friendship, and fun. As Grandma Rose said: "Dream it, design it, and do it." You've earned the right to focus on the dreams.

### Your #1 Fix (Based on Your Lowest Category)

Look at which category scored lowest. That's your biggest opportunity:

| If Your Lowest Category Is... | Your First Move Is... | Time to Set Up |
|------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Pay Yourself First | Open or increase automatic retirement contribution to at least 1% of gross income | 10 minutes |
| Emergency Protection | Open a separate high-yield savings account and set up $10/day automatic transfer | 10 minutes |
| Dream Account | Name your #1 financial dream, set a dollar target, open a dedicated account, automate a monthly transfer | 15 minutes |
| Debt Elimination | List every debt smallest to largest, set all minimums to automatic, put all extra cash toward the smallest one | 20 minutes |
| Homeownership Track | Calculate your 10-year rent cost, start a "down payment" automatic savings, look into first-time buyer programs | 30 minutes |
| Investment Automation | Open an account at Fidelity/Schwab/Vanguard, pick a target-date fund or VTI, set up automatic monthly investment | 10 minutes |
| Subscription & Spending Leak | Go to phone Settings > Subscriptions right now, cancel everything you don't use, redirect that money to investing | 5 minutes |
| Protection & Planning | Make a will (online services make it easy), have "the financial conversation" with your partner this weekend | 1 hour |

### The Math That Changes Everything

Here's what happens when you find just $27.40 a day and invest it:

| If You Start At Age... | And Invest $27.40/Day at 10% Until 65... | You'll Have... |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| 25 | 40 years | $4,424,000 |
| 30 | 35 years | $2,635,000 |
| 35 | 30 years | $1,555,000 |
| 40 | 25 years | $902,000 |
| 45 | 20 years | $505,000 |
| 50 | 15 years | $266,000 |

Can't find $27.40 a day? Start with $10. Start with $5. Start with $1.

The only number that guarantees you'll have nothing at retirement is zero.

### What to Do Next
