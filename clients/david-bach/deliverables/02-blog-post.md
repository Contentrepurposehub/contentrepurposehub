You become an automatic millionaire by setting up a system where money moves from your paycheck into retirement, emergency, and dream accounts automatically — before you have a chance to spend it. The exact formula: save 12.5% of your gross income (one hour of your daily pay) into a retirement account, 5% into an emergency fund, and 5% into a dream account. All automatic. No budget. No discipline required. The system does the work.

That's it. That's the answer.

Now let me show you exactly how it works, why it works when everything else fails, and the specific steps to set it up in less than 10 minutes.

## The Quick Version (For People Who Want the System Right Now)

- **$27.40 a day** invested at 10% annually for 40 years = **$4,424,000**
- That's $10,000 a year. The cost of a daily cocktail, a lunch out, and a subscription you forgot to cancel.
- The money moves **automatically** from your paycheck before you see it
- **70% stocks / 30% bonds** in low-cost index funds (VTI, QQQ, or a target-date fund)
- No budget. No spreadsheets. No willpower required.
- 654,000 people in Fidelity 401k plans alone are now millionaires doing exactly this
- There are 24 million millionaires in the US right now — up 8 million in just 20 years

## Why Most People Fail at Building Wealth (It's Not What You Think)

I spent 9 years at Morgan Stanley as a financial adviser. I sat across the table from hundreds of people. And I can tell you the single biggest reason people fail to build wealth:

**Their financial plan requires them to do something.**

Write a budget. Track expenses. Transfer money manually. Check in every month. Make decisions about where the money goes.

Here's what happens in the real world: people do it for a month. Maybe two. Maybe six if they're really motivated. Then they stop.

I never had a client who committed to bringing me a check every month save for more than six months. Never. They always stopped.

You know who never stops taking money from you? The government. Your landlord. Netflix. Your gym. Your phone company.

They all take money from you automatically. Why? Because they know if they waited for you to send a check, you wouldn't.

The government doesn't ask you to budget to pay your taxes. They take your taxes from you automatically. They take Social Security from you automatically. They know you won't have anything to give if they don't take it first.

**That's the insight that changes everything.** If automatic works for everyone who wants your money, it should work for you, too.

## The Couple Who Changed My Life (And Made Me Realize I Was Doing Everything Wrong)

I was 26 years old. A financial adviser at Morgan Stanley. Making over $100,000 a year.

And I was broke.

Not "I wish I had more money" broke. Actually broke. Spending more than I was making. Living paycheck to paycheck on a six-figure income.

Then Jim and Sue McIntyre walked into my office.

They were 52. Ordinary people with ordinary jobs. Their average income over their lifetime had been $40,000 a year. That year they'd made a little over $53,000.

Jim put all their statements on the table. I sat there and added them up.

**Their net worth: $1.8 million.**

I sat back and said, "How did you do this?"

And Sue said something I'll never forget: "We didn't have a budget because budgets don't work. We put everything on autopilot. We saved money automatically for everything."

They'd bought a home in San Leandro, California. Paid off the mortgage. Bought a second house on the same street. Paid that off too. Rented the first one for income. And they'd been saving automatically into their retirement accounts for 30 years.

Jim was retiring at 52. On a $40,000 average salary.

I was making more than double what they made, and I had nothing.

That day, I went home and changed everything about my financial life. Not because I suddenly found discipline. Because I finally understood that discipline was never the answer.

**Automation was.**

## The Automatic Millionaire Formula: Pay Yourself First

Here's the system. It's built on one principle: **the first person who gets paid is you.**

Not your landlord. Not the credit card company. Not Amazon. You.

When your paycheck hits your account, money should move automatically into three places before you can touch it:

### The Three Buckets

| Bucket | Purpose | How Much | Where It Goes |
|--------|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Future** | Retirement | 12.5% of gross income (1 hour of your daily pay) | 401k, IRA, or pension equivalent |
| **Safety** | Emergencies | 5% of gross income | High-yield savings account |
| **Dreams** | Your goals | 5% of gross income | Dedicated savings account |

**Total: 22.5% of your gross income.**

Now, before the "yeah butters" start — I hear you.

"Yeah, but I can't save 22.5% of my income."

Then start at 1%.

If you're not saving anything right now and all you do after reading this is set up an automatic transfer of 1% of your income, your life will change. Not because 1% is a lot of money. Because you start the process.

Here's what I tell people: start at 1% this month. Next month, bump it to 2%. The month after, 3%. In 12 months, you'll be saving 12% — four times what the average American saves — and you won't even notice the difference because each bump is so small.

It's the financial equivalent of going to the gym. You don't start with 300 pounds on the bar. You start with the bar.

## The Latte Factor: Where Your $27.40 a Day Is Going

I've been teaching this concept for 30 years, and people either love me for it or hate me for it.

Here's the idea: we waste small amounts of money every single day without thinking about it. Not because we're irresponsible. Because these phones are designed to get you to spend everything. The algorithms, the one-click buying, the subscription auto-renewals — there's better technology today than there's ever been to get you to spend more money.

And nobody wants you to spend money once. They want you to spend money for a lifetime. That's what "lifetime value of a customer" means. There's a battle for your income, and everyone wants a piece of it.

So here's the question: **How much money do you need to spend per day to blow $10,000 a year?**

$27.40.

That's one lunch out ($25), one fancy coffee ($9.50 in New York), one cocktail at a hotel ($31.50). It's the eight subscriptions on your phone you forgot to cancel.

When Steven Bartlett checked his phone during our conversation, he found 11 active subscriptions. He'd keep 3. The other 8 had been running in the background, draining money for months.

### What $27.40 a Day Becomes If You Invest It Instead

| Years Invested | Amount Invested | Value at 10% Annual Return |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| 10 years | $100,000 | $175,000 |
| 20 years | $200,000 | $630,000 |
| 30 years | $300,000 | $1,555,000 |
| 40 years | $400,000 | $4,424,000 |

Read that last line again. You put in $400,000 over 40 years. You end up with $4.4 million. That's the power of compound interest in boring index funds.

### "Yeah, But I Can't Save $27.40 a Day"

Then save $10. Save $5. Save $1.

Here's a challenge I give people who are really struggling: **save $10 a day for 100 days.**

That gets you to $1,000. You now have more savings than 50% of Americans. That's not a metaphor — four out of 10 Americans literally cannot get their hands on $1,000 for an emergency.

The point isn't the number. The point is starting. Fitness is built through daily action. Savings, the same thing.

## Where to Invest (Keep It Boring)

Your money and your investments should be boring. Your life should be interesting.

If someone's at a cocktail party talking about their investments and it's exciting, something's wrong with it. Sexy is how you go broke when it comes to money. Boring is beautiful when it comes to wealth.

My son asked me the other day, "Dad, why aren't you trading Tesla stock?" And I told him: "Because you can't make money trading. You've got to figure out when to buy and when to sell. I want you investing in index funds."

Here's what the data actually shows:

### Index Fund Performance (Real Numbers)

| Fund | Symbol | What It Is | 10-Year Annual Return |
|------|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| Vanguard Total Stock Market | VTI | 3,500 US stocks | 14% |
| NASDAQ 100 ETF | QQQ | Top 100 tech stocks | 19% (480% total) |
| Vanguard Global ex-US | VXUS | International stocks | 35% last year |
| Vanguard Balanced Fund | VBIAX | 60% stocks / 40% bonds | 8%+ since inception |

You don't have to pick stocks. You don't have to watch CNBC. You don't have to follow crypto Twitter.

You buy one of these funds. You set up automatic monthly investments. You don't touch it for decades.

That's it. That's how 654,000 people in Fidelity 401k plans became millionaires. The exact formula: they saved 14% of their gross income, their employer matched on top, and they invested roughly 70% in stocks and 30% in bonds.

**The average American saves 3-5%.** The millionaires saved 14%. That's the entire difference.

### What About Target-Date Funds?

If you don't want to think about this at all — and honestly, that's fine — look into target-date mutual funds. These are one-stop-shop funds that automatically adjust your stock/bond mix as you get closer to retirement. More stocks when you're young, more bonds as you age.

There are trillions of dollars in these funds now. When I wrote The Automatic Millionaire 20 years ago, they were just getting started. They've changed the game for millions of Americans who don't want to manage their own portfolio.

## Why You Need to Buy a Home (The Myth I Want to Bust)

I know what you've heard. "Renting is smarter." "A house is a bad investment." "You should put that money in the stock market instead."

I've spent 33 years watching how ordinary people actually build wealth. And I can tell you: **homeowners in America are worth 40 times more than renters.**

The average homeowner: $400,000 in net worth.
The average renter: $10,000.

"But David, that doesn't prove buying a home made them rich."

It actually does. Here's why.

### The Leverage Effect

When you buy a home, you don't pay cash. You put down 20% and borrow 80%.

Take a $200,000 home. You put $40,000 down. The home doubles to $400,000 in 10 years. (This has happened in markets all over the US since COVID — housing prices up 100-200% in many areas.)

You made $200,000 in profit. But you didn't invest $200,000. You invested $40,000. That's a five-times return on your down payment.

Then you go to sell. If you've owned it for over two years, you pay zero taxes on the gain — up to $250,000 if you're single, over $500,000 if you're married.

Try getting that deal in the stock market.

### "But I'll Take the Money and Invest It Instead"

It is an absolute freaking myth that people take the money they would have used to buy a house and invest it in the stock market. They don't do that.

In the real world, people rent an apartment that's nicer than what they can afford, spend all their money, and turn around at 35 with no equity and no savings.

I lived in New York City for 18 years. When I moved there in 2001, a nice apartment was $6,000 a month. When I left, that same apartment was $25,000 a month. I owned mine — it went up $3 million in value. My friends who rented for 20 years built zero net worth.

Somebody's getting rich in every rental transaction. If you're the renter, you're not the one getting rich.

### The Real Numbers on Home Equity

- **$34 trillion** now in home equity in America (Wall Street Journal, 2025)
- Home equity has gone up **90% since before COVID**
- **$45 trillion** in retirement accounts (60-70% in stocks)
- Those two numbers together: **$80 trillion** in wealth

That's where the breadcrumbs are. That's where wealth is actually being created. In homes and in the stock market. If you're not in one or both, you're being left behind.

## How to Get Out of Debt First: The DOLP System

If you're in debt right now, I get it. When I came out of college with $12,000 in credit card debt, I remember opening my bills and having the room spin. It felt like carrying a 50-pound backpack everywhere.

Here's the formula. It's called **DOLP: Dead On Last Payment.**

### Step-by-Step

1. **List every debt** — smallest balance to largest. I don't care about the interest rate right now. List them by size.
2. **Set ALL minimum payments to automatic.** Go online right now and make every minimum payment automatic. This is non-negotiable. You never miss a payment again.
3. **Put all extra money toward the smallest debt.** Every spare dollar attacks that smallest balance.
4. **When the smallest is paid off, don't close the account** (it protects your credit score). Roll that entire payment to the next smallest debt.
5. **Repeat until debt-free.** Each card that gets paid off frees up more money for the next one. This is why some people call it the snowball approach.

Then, and only then, attack the interest rates. Call your credit card companies. Negotiate lower rates. Look into balance transfers (but be careful — one late payment and they jack the rate back up).

Here's the most important thing: **when you get out of debt, don't celebrate on the credit cards.** I got myself out of debt in college, went out and celebrated, and got right back into debt. People do this all the time. Usually at least twice.

After I got out of debt the second time, I didn't carry a credit card for 30 years. Debit card only. Forced me to spend only what I had.

## How to Set It Up in 10 Minutes

Here's the specific action plan. You can do all of this today.

### Step 1: Open the accounts (5 minutes)
Go to **Fidelity**, **Charles Schwab**, **Vanguard**, or **Acorns** (if you want to start by rounding up spare change). Open a brokerage account or IRA if you don't have a 401k through work.

### Step 2: Pick a fund (1 minute)
Choose ONE:
- **VTI** (Vanguard Total Stock Market) — 3,500 US stocks, 14% annual returns over last 10 years
- **A target-date fund** matching your retirement year — automatic rebalancing, zero decisions
- **Vanguard Balanced Fund** (VBIAX) — if you want 60/40 stocks/bonds, more conservative

### Step 3: Set up automatic transfers (3 minutes)
- **Retirement:** 12.5% of gross income (or start at 1% and increase monthly)
- **Emergency:** 5% into a separate high-yield savings account
- **Dreams:** 5% into another separate account, labeled for your goal

Set these to transfer **the same day your paycheck hits.** Not the day after. Not at the end of the month. The same day. Money you never see is money you never spend.

### Step 4: Automate your debt payments (1 minute)
Set every credit card and loan to automatic minimum payments. Then direct any extra money to the smallest balance.

**That's it.** Your financial life is now on autopilot. You don't have to think about this again until your annual review.

## The Story That Started It All: My Grandmother's Decision at 30

My grandmother, Rose Bach, made a decision at 30 years old that changed the entire trajectory of our family.

She turned to my grandfather on her birthday — a cold day — and said: "We don't have any money. We're living paycheck to paycheck. I don't want to retire here. I want to go to California where it's warm."

My grandfather asked what she wanted to do about it. She said: **"We need to change what we're doing, or nothing will change."**

She started saving 50 cents a week out of her paycheck. My grandfather did the same. They were middle-class people. No college education. He worked in a plant. She worked in retail.

Over her lifetime, she became an investor. She became a self-made millionaire. She retired to California.

When I was seven, she took me to McDonald's and taught me a lesson that changed my life. She said there are three types of people in the world: consumers (the people eating), employees (the people working for minimum wage), and investors (the people who own the place).

Then she took me to a brokerage firm and helped me buy my first share of McDonald's stock.

One woman's decision had a ripple effect through our entire family. She taught my father, who became a financial adviser for 45 years. My sister became a financial adviser. I became a financial adviser. I've spent 30 years teaching millions of people the lessons she taught me.

Her philosophy was three words: **"Dream it, design it, and do it."**

And she always said: **"You're going to run out of time."**

## Why Right Now Is the Time to Start

I believe the next 10 years will be the greatest opportunity to build wealth in our lifetime.

AI is making companies more profitable and more productive than they've ever been. The returns in the stock market from last year were a direct result of AI. This is creating wealth at a pace we've never seen.

But here's the other side.

Social Security is projected to be underfunded by 2033. The government is telling us they'll have to cut benefits by 20%. Sixty million Americans depend on that $1,900 monthly check. When those cuts come, a lot of people are going to be in real trouble.

The safety nets that people are counting on are buckling. Governments have more debt than they've ever had. People are living longer. The math doesn't work.

No one is coming to save you. You're going to have to save yourself.

The good news? The stock market has gone up 600% in 20 years. Housing has gone up 400%. There are now 24 million millionaires in the United States — up 8 million in just two decades.

Wealth is being created at an extraordinary rate. The question is whether you're going to be part of it.

The window is open. But you have to walk through it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much do I need to save per day to become a millionaire?

$27.40 per day ($10,000 per year) invested at a 10% average annual return will grow to approximately $4,424,000 in 40 years. If you can't start at $27.40, start at $10 a day ($3,650/year), which would grow to approximately $1,600,000 over 40 years at the same rate. Even $5 a day adds up to approximately $800,000 over 40 years.

### What's the difference between the automatic millionaire method and regular budgeting?

Budgeting requires you to track spending, make decisions every day, and exercise discipline month after month. The automatic millionaire method removes all of that. Money moves automatically from your paycheck into savings and investments before you can spend it. You don't budget what's left — you invest first and live on what remains. In 33 years of financial advising, I've never seen a client succeed long-term with a budget. I've seen thousands succeed with automation.

### What is the "pay yourself first" strategy?

Pay yourself first means the first money from every paycheck goes to you — not your bills, not your landlord, not Amazon. Specifically, 12.5% of your gross income (equivalent to one hour of your daily pay) goes directly into a retirement account like a 401k or IRA. This happens automatically on payday, before you can spend it. The government already does this with your taxes. You should do it with your savings.

### Is it better to invest in the stock market or buy a home?

Both. They're the two primary escalators to wealth. Homeowners in America are worth 40 times more than renters ($400,000 average net worth vs. $10,000). The stock market has returned 600% over the last 20 years. Housing has returned 400%. But here's the key difference: when you buy a home, you use leverage (putting 20% down and borrowing 80%), which multiplies your returns. And you get tax-free gains up to $250,000 (single) or $500,000+ (married). The myth that you should rent and invest the difference rarely works in the real world — most people just spend the difference instead.

### What's the best index fund for beginners?

For a single, simple starting point: the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) holds 3,500 US stocks and has returned approximately 14% annually over the last 10 years. If you want a set-it-and-forget-it approach, a target-date mutual fund (available through most 401k plans, Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab) automatically adjusts your investment mix as you age. If you want some stock and some bond exposure, the Vanguard Balanced Fund (VBIAX) offers a 60/40 split and has averaged over 8% since inception.

### How do I get out of credit card debt using the DOLP method?

DOLP (Dead On Last Payment) works in four steps: (1) List all debts from smallest balance to largest. (2) Set every minimum payment to automatic so you never miss one. (3) Put all extra money toward the smallest balance first. (4) When the smallest is paid off, roll that full payment to the next smallest. Don't close paid-off accounts — keeping them open protects your credit score. This method works because you see progress fast, which keeps you motivated.

### What if I can only save $5 or $10 a day?

Start there. $10 a day for 100 days gets you to $1,000 — more savings than half of Americans have. $5 a day invested at 10% for 40 years grows to approximately $800,000. $10 a day becomes approximately $1,600,000. The specific dollar amount matters less than the habit of automating it. Start at whatever you can — even 1% of your income — and increase by 1% per month.

### How long does it take to become an automatic millionaire?

At $27.40 per day (about $10,000/year) invested at 10% average annual return: approximately 30-35 years to reach $1 million, and 40 years to reach $4.4 million. Starting earlier dramatically changes the math. At age 25 with 40 years to invest, you'd reach millionaire status in your mid-50s. At age 35 with 30 years, you'd still accumulate approximately $1.5 million. The key: start now with whatever amount you can, make it automatic, and let compound interest do the heavy lifting.
