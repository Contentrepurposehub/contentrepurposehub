# Thread 1: The Automatic Millionaire Formula (Angle 2 — 654,000 Proof)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
654,000 people in Fidelity 401k plans are now millionaires.

Not crypto bros. Not tech founders. Not trust fund kids.

Regular people with regular jobs who followed one exact formula.

Here it is. Every step. 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
First — let's demolish the biggest lie in personal finance:

"You need to earn more money to be rich."

We know for a fact that's wrong. 1 in 3 households earning $150K/year are still broke.

The problem was never your income. It was never having a system.

**Tweet 3:**
The 654,000 millionaires at Fidelity all do the same thing:

- Save 14% of gross income
- Get the employer match on top
- Invest 70% stocks / 30% bonds
- Let it run automatically

That's it. That's the formula. No stock picking. No timing the market. No spreadsheets.

**Tweet 4:**
Here's why "automatically" is the key word.

The government doesn't ask you to budget to pay your taxes. They take them before you ever see the money.

Do the same thing for yourself. Set it up once so your first hour of income goes to YOU — not to your landlord, not to Amazon, not to DoorDash.

**Tweet 5:**
"First hour of income" — let me break that down.

You work an 8-hour day. The first hour = 12.5% of your gross pay.

That 12.5% moves to your 401k or retirement account the day your paycheck hits.

Before you can touch it. Before you can spend it. Before the algorithms can sell you something.

**Tweet 6:**
"But 14% is a lot."

Is it? The average American saves 3-5%. That's why the average American retires broke.

The 654,000 who became millionaires? They saved 14%.

The gap between broke and millionaire is 10 percentage points. That's it.

**Tweet 7:**
The allocation matters too.

70% stocks. 30% bonds. Not 100% stocks (too volatile, you'll panic-sell in a crash). Not 50/50 (too conservative, you'll miss the growth).

70/30 is the sweet spot. It's what the data shows over and over.

**Tweet 8:**
Now let me give you the proof that this works for ANYONE.

Jim and Sue McIntyre. Average household income: $40,000 a year. Not a typo. Forty thousand.

They retired at 52 with a net worth of $1.8 million.

Here's what they did.

**Tweet 9:**
The McIntyres:

1. Automated their savings into 401k (14%+)
2. Bought two houses on the same street in San Leandro, CA
3. Lived in one, rented the other for income
4. Paid both mortgages off
5. Let the 401k compound for decades

No inheritance. No lottery. No side hustle. Just the system running on autopilot.

**Tweet 10:**
There are 24 million millionaires in America right now. That's up 8 million in just 20 years.

The escalator is moving. Stocks and real estate. $45 trillion in retirement accounts. $34 trillion in home equity.

You either get on the escalator or you watch it carry everyone else up.

**Tweet 11:**
The formula one more time:

1. Save 14% of gross income (your first hour)
2. Automate it into your 401k / retirement account
3. Get the employer match (free money)
4. Invest 70% stocks / 30% bonds
5. Never touch it

No budgeting. No willpower. No discipline required. Just a system.

# Thread 2: The 40x Wealth Gap (Angle 4 — Homeowners vs Renters)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Homeowners in America are worth 40 times more than renters.

Not 2x. Not 5x. Not 10x.

40x.

Average homeowner: $400,000+ net worth.
Average renter: $10,000.

Here's the math that nobody talks about. 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The usual argument against buying a home goes like this:

"Robert Schiller proved housing only appreciates 1% a year after inflation. After maintenance, taxes, and insurance, the real return is basically zero."

Sounds smart. Gets cited everywhere.

It is an absolute freaking myth.

**Tweet 3:**
Here's why those numbers aren't real world.

Nobody buys a house with cash. You put 20% down and the bank lends you the other 80%.

$200,000 house. You put $40,000 down. The house doubles to $400,000.

Your $40,000 just turned into $200,000 in profit. That's a 5x return on your actual money.

Show me a savings account that does that.

**Tweet 4:**
"But the stock market went up 600% in 20 years! Real estate only went up 400%!"

Sure. On paper.

But here's what the stock market people always leave out: leverage.

Nobody puts 20% down on an index fund and borrows the other 80% at a fixed rate for 30 years.

With real estate, that's exactly what you do.

**Tweet 5:**
Now let's talk about what renters actually do with the "savings" from not buying.

The academic argument: "Renters save the difference and invest it in the stock market."

In the real world? They don't do that. Almost nobody does that.

The extra money goes to lifestyle, to subscriptions, to the algorithm selling them stuff they don't need.

**Tweet 6:**
Let's run the rent math.

$5,000/month in rent. That's not unusual in a major city.

Over 10 years: $600,000 — gone.
Over 20 years: $1.2 million — gone.
Over 30 years: $2 million — gone.

And rents always go up. That $5,000/month today becomes $8,000. Then $12,000. Then $15,000.

You're on a treadmill that only speeds up.

**Tweet 7:**
Meanwhile, the homeowner:

- Locks in a fixed mortgage payment (it never goes up)
- Builds equity every single month
- Gets $250K tax-free on the sale (single) or $500K+ (married)
- Owns an asset that's gone up 400% in 20 years
- Can borrow against it, rent it, or pass it to their kids

The renter gets a receipt.

**Tweet 8:**
Here's the part that should make you angry.

Corporate America is buying up single-family homes across the country. Entire neighborhoods.

They are betting that your generation never buys. That you stay a renter forever. That you keep paying THEM $5,000/month while they build the equity.

Somebody's getting rich in the renting transaction. If you're the renter, you're not the one.

**Tweet 9:**
$34 trillion. That's how much home equity exists in America right now. Up 90% since before COVID.

$45 trillion sits in retirement accounts — 60-70% of that in stocks.

Stocks and real estate. Those are the two escalators to wealth. If you're not on at least one of them, you are being left behind.

The breadcrumbs are right in front of us.

40x is not a gap you close later. You close it now or it widens.
