## PROBLEM SECTION

### You've Tried to Be Good With Money. It Didn't Work.

You downloaded the budgeting app. You tracked expenses for a few weeks. You told yourself "I'll save more this month."

Then your phone bill hit. A friend's birthday dinner. A subscription you forgot about. A late-night Amazon order you barely remember.

And just like that, the money was gone. Again.

Here's what nobody tells you: **the problem isn't you.**

The problem is that every financial plan you've ever tried requires you to do something — track, budget, transfer, decide, remember. And in the real world, people do those things for a month. Maybe two. Then they stop.

I know because I spent 9 years as a financial adviser at Morgan Stanley watching it happen. I never had a single client who committed to saving manually make it more than six months. Not one.

Meanwhile, every company that wants your money has figured out the secret: **they take it automatically.**

Your gym doesn't wait for you to send a check. Netflix doesn't hope you'll remember to pay. The government doesn't ask you to budget for taxes — they take them before you see your paycheck.

They all know what you haven't figured out yet:

**If it's not automatic, it won't happen.**

---

## THE SYSTEM SECTION

### The Automatic Millionaire System

What if your wealth worked the same way your Netflix subscription does? Money moves. You don't think about it. It just happens.

That's what this book teaches. A system you set up once — in less than 10 minutes — and then it runs in the background building wealth while you live your life.

No budget. No spreadsheet. No monthly check-ins. No discipline required.

**The formula:**

| What | How Much | Where |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Pay Yourself First** | 12.5% of gross income (1 hour of your daily pay) | Retirement account (401k, IRA, pension) |
| **Protect Yourself** | 5% of gross income | Emergency savings account |
| **Fund Your Dreams** | 5% of gross income | Dream account (house, travel, education, freedom) |

Money moves automatically on payday. Before you can spend it. Before you can talk yourself out of it. Before life gets in the way.

**Can't start at 12.5%?** Start at 1%. Increase by 1% each month. In 12 months you'll be saving four times what the average American saves. And you won't even notice the difference.

## PROOF SECTION

### The Math That Changes Everything

$27.40 a day. That's one lunch out. One cocktail. One subscription you forgot to cancel.

Invested automatically in a boring index fund at 10% average annual return:

| Years | You Put In | It Grows To |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 10 years | $100,000 | $175,000 |
| 20 years | $200,000 | $630,000 |
| 30 years | $300,000 | $1,555,000 |
| **40 years** | **$400,000** | **$4,424,000** |

Can't do $27.40? Here's what smaller amounts become:

| Daily Amount | In 40 Years |
|-------------|-------------|
| $5 a day | $800,000 |
| $10 a day | $1,600,000 |
| $15 a day | $2,400,000 |
| $27.40 a day | $4,424,000 |

**The stock market has averaged over 10% annually with reinvested dividends for more than 100 years.** This isn't speculation. This is what happens when you buy a boring index fund and leave it alone.

## SOCIAL PROOF: THE PEOPLE WHO PROVED IT

### Jim and Sue McIntyre

Jim and Sue walked into my office at Morgan Stanley when they were 52. Average income over their lifetime: $40,000 a year. No budget. No fancy investments. Everything on autopilot.

**Their net worth: $1.8 million.**

They owned two homes free and clear. They had a fully funded retirement account. Jim was ready to retire at 52 on a $40,000 salary.

I was making more than double what they made. I was broke.

That meeting changed my life. It's why this book exists.

### Grandma Rose

My grandmother Rose didn't have a college degree. My grandfather worked in a plant. She worked in retail. At 30, on a cold birthday, she decided she didn't want to be poor anymore.

She started saving 50 cents a week.

Over her lifetime, she became a self-made millionaire. Retired to California. And she started a ripple effect that's now reached millions of people: she taught my father (financial adviser for 45 years), my sister (financial adviser), and me.

**One decision. 50 cents a week. A family transformed.**

### The 654,000

That's the number of people in Fidelity 401k plans who are now millionaires. They saved 14% of their gross income. Their employers matched on top. They invested 70% stocks, 30% bonds.

The average American saves 3-5%.

The millionaires saved 14%.

That's the entire difference.

## WHAT'S INSIDE SECTION

### What You'll Learn in The Automatic Millionaire

This isn't theory. This is the exact system, step by step, in plain English.

**The Pay Yourself First Plan**
How to set up the three automatic accounts (Future, Safety, Dreams) in less than 10 minutes. The exact percentages. The exact sequence. Where to open them, what to buy, how to automate everything.

**The Latte Factor**
How to find $5, $10, or $27.40 a day you're currently wasting — without giving up anything that actually matters to you. Includes the subscription audit that found Steven Bartlett 8 subscriptions he didn't know he was paying for.

**The DOLP System (Getting Out of Debt)**
Dead On Last Payment — the debt elimination formula. List your debts smallest to largest. Automate minimums on everything. Attack the smallest first. Watch the snowball build. Specific steps, specific order, nothing left to figure out.

**The Homeownership Advantage**
Why homeowners are worth 40x more than renters ($400,000 vs $10,000 average). The leverage math that makes real estate the highest-return investment most people will ever make. How to buy your first home even when you think you can't afford it.

**The Bi-Weekly Mortgage Payoff**

## WHO THIS IS FOR

### This Book Is For You If:

**You make money but don't know where it goes.** You earn $40K, $75K, $100K, $150K — and somehow there's nothing left at the end of the month. You're not reckless. You just don't have a system.

**You've tried budgeting and it didn't stick.** Budgets require discipline. This system doesn't. That's the point.

**You're in debt and it feels like quicksand.** The DOLP system gives you a specific, step-by-step plan to dig out. No shame. Just math.

**You're renting and wondering if you'll ever own a home.** The book shows you how to get in the game — even if you have to split a down payment with a friend and rent out bedrooms. I did it. Millions of others have too.

**You're a woman who's delegated finances to someone else.** The average age of widowhood in America is 59. You cannot delegate your financial well-being to anyone. Period.

**You're a couple who fights about money.** Money fights are the #1 cause of divorce. This book has a system for getting on the same page even if you're financial opposites.

**You're young and think you have time.** You do — and that's your biggest advantage. Someone who starts at 25 with $10 a day will have $1.6 million by retirement. Someone who starts at 45 gets $266,000. Time is the multiplier.

**You're not young and think it's too late.** It's not. Jim and Sue McIntyre didn't start getting serious until their 20s and retired at 52 with $1.8 million on a $40,000 income. My grandmother started with 50 cents a week at 30.

### This Book Is NOT For You If:

**You're looking for a get-rich-quick strategy.** This is a get-rich-boring strategy. If you want to trade meme coins and options, this isn't your book. (People who try to get rich quick stay broke forever.)

**You're not willing to set up automatic transfers.** The system only works if it's automatic. If you insist on doing everything manually, save yourself the read.

**You want someone to manage everything for you.** This book teaches you how to do it yourself in 10 minutes. If you want a full-service financial adviser, that's a different path.

## URGENCY SECTION

### Why Now?

The next 10 years will be the greatest opportunity to build wealth in our lifetime. AI is creating more productivity and profit than we've ever seen. The stock market went up 600% in 20 years. Housing went up 400%. There are 24 million millionaires in America right now.

At the same time:

- Social Security is projected to be cut 20% by 2033 — less than 8 years away
- 60 million Americans depend on a $1,900/month Social Security check
- 41.5 million Americans receive food assistance at $6/day
- 7 out of 10 Americans are living paycheck to paycheck
- 37% can't cover a $400 emergency

**The window is open.** Wealth is being created at an extraordinary rate. But the safety nets people are counting on are buckling.

No one is coming to save you. You're going to have to save yourself.

The Automatic Millionaire shows you how — in less than 10 minutes.

## FAQ SECTION

**"I can barely pay my bills. How am I supposed to save?"**
Start with 1%. If you make $3,000 a month, that's $30. You won't notice it. Increase by 1% each month. In a year, you're saving 12%. Or try the $10/Day for 100 Days Challenge — it gets you to $1,000, which is more than half of Americans have saved.

**"Don't I need to make a lot of money first?"**
Jim and Sue McIntyre averaged $40,000 a year and retired at 52 with $1.8 million. My grandmother started with 50 cents a week. The system works at any income level because it's about the percentage, not the dollar amount.

**"Is this just another budgeting book?"**
The opposite. I teach that budgets don't work. This book is about building a system where you never have to budget again. The money moves before you can spend it. No tracking. No spreadsheets. No willpower.

**"I'm in debt. Should I save or pay off debt first?"**
Both. The book shows you how to use the DOLP system to attack debt while simultaneously automating small savings. The key is making minimum payments automatic on everything, then attacking the smallest balance first.

**"What if the stock market crashes?"**
The stock market has averaged over 10% annually for more than 100 years. It drops, it recovers, it goes higher. The people who get rich are the ones who keep investing automatically through the drops. The people who get hurt are the ones who panic and sell.

**"I'm in my 40s/50s. Is it too late?"**
$27.40 a day at age 45 still becomes $505,000 by 65. At age 50, it's $266,000. At any age, that's worth a lot more than zero. And if you own a home, you're building equity on top of that.

**"What's different about this updated edition?"**
New fund recommendations (VTI, QQQ, target-date funds), strategies for the AI economy, current data on housing and retirement wealth, 20 years of updated success stories from readers, and the $10/Day for 100 Days Challenge for people starting from zero.

## FINAL CTA SECTION

### One Decision. One Setup. That's How It Starts.

My grandmother made a decision at 30 on a cold birthday that changed our entire family's destiny.

Jim and Sue McIntyre made a decision in their 20s that let them retire at 52 on a $40,000 salary.

I made a decision in my mid-20s, after a couple sat across from me with $1.8 million and I had nothing, that changed my life forever.

The decision is always the same: **make it automatic.**

You'll work 90,000 hours over your lifetime. You'll earn millions of dollars. The only question is: will you keep any of it?

As my grandmother used to say: "We need to change what we're doing, or nothing will change."
