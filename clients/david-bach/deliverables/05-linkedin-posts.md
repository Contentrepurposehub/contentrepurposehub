## Post 1: THOUGHT LEADERSHIP — The $27.40 Math

**Hook Type:** Specific number + curiosity gap

---

$27.40 a day.

That's the difference between retiring broke and retiring with $4.4 million.

I've been teaching this for 30 years and people still don't believe me until they see the math:

$27.40 a day = $10,000 a year.

$10,000 a year invested at 10% for 40 years = $4,424,000.

That's one lunch out. One cocktail. One subscription you forgot to cancel.

When I sat down with Steven Bartlett on his podcast, he pulled up his phone and found 11 active subscriptions. He'd keep 3. The other 8 had been draining money for months.

Right now, open your phone. Go to Settings > Subscriptions.

I guarantee you'll find $50-$200 a month you didn't know you were spending.

The question isn't whether you can afford to save $27.40 a day.

The question is whether you can afford not to.

## Post 2: STORY-BASED — Grandma Rose's Decision at 30

**Hook Type:** Story opening + emotional pull

---

My grandmother made a decision at 30 years old that changed the entire destiny of our family.

She turned to my grandfather on her birthday and said:

"We don't have any money. We're living paycheck to paycheck. I don't want to retire here."

My grandfather asked what she wanted to do about it.

She said: "We need to change what we're doing, or nothing will change."

She didn't have a college degree. My grandfather worked in a plant. She worked in retail. They were ordinary people.

She started saving 50 cents a week.

Over her lifetime, she became a self-made millionaire. She retired to California.

But here's what most people miss about her story:

Her decision created a ripple effect that's still going.

She taught my father → he became a financial adviser for 45 years.
My sister → became a financial adviser.
Me → spent 33 years teaching millions about money.

One woman. 50 cents a week. A family transformed.

When you make a financial decision today, you're not just deciding for yourself.

You're deciding for your kids. Your grandkids. Generations you'll never meet.

What decision are you going to make today?

## Post 3: THOUGHT LEADERSHIP — Homeowners vs. Renters

**Hook Type:** Startling stat + myth-busting

---

Homeowners in America are worth 40 times more than renters.

Average homeowner: $400,000 in net worth.
Average renter: $10,000.

"But David, that doesn't prove buying a home made them rich."

It actually does. Here's why:

When you buy a $200,000 home with 20% down, you put in $40,000. Home doubles in 10 years (this has happened all over the US since COVID). You made $200,000 on a $40,000 investment.

That's a 5x return.

Then you sell. If you've owned for 2+ years: $250,000 in tax-free gains if single. $500,000+ if married.

Try getting that deal in the stock market.

I know what you've heard. "Renting is smarter. Put the difference in index funds."

Here's what happens in the real world: people rent an apartment nicer than they can afford, spend all their money, and turn around at 35 with no equity and no savings.

It is an absolute freaking myth that people take the extra money and invest it. They don't.

I lived in New York for 18 years. My apartment went up $3 million in value. My friends who rented for 20 years built zero net worth.

Somebody's getting rich in every rental transaction. If you're the renter, you're not the one.

$34 trillion in US home equity right now. Up 90% since pre-COVID.

That's where the breadcrumbs are.

## Post 4: STORY-BASED — The McIntyres (The Couple Who Changed My Life)

**Hook Type:** Personal vulnerability + contrast

---

I was 26 years old. A financial adviser at Morgan Stanley. Making over $100,000 a year.

And I was broke.

Then Jim and Sue McIntyre walked into my office.

They were 52. Average lifetime income: $40,000 a year. Ordinary jobs. No fancy investments.

Jim put their statements on the table. I added them up.

Net worth: $1.8 million.

I sat back and asked: "How did you do this?"

Sue said: "We didn't have a budget because budgets don't work. We put everything on autopilot."

Here's what they did:

→ Automatic retirement savings from every paycheck
→ Bought a home in San Leandro, CA. Paid it off.
→ Bought a second home on the same street. Paid that off.
→ Rented the first house for income
→ Never stopped saving. Never stopped automating.

Jim retired at 52. On $40,000 a year.

I was making double their income and had nothing to show for it.

That meeting changed my life. Not because I suddenly found discipline. Because I finally understood that discipline was never the answer.

Automation was.

That's why I wrote The Automatic Millionaire. And it's why I just updated it for a new generation.

If a couple on $40K/year can do it, what's stopping you?

## Post 5: FRAMEWORK/HOW-TO — The Three Bucket System

**Hook Type:** Step-by-step framework with clear numbers

---

Here's the exact system that built 24 million millionaires.

3 accounts. Automated on payday. Takes 10 minutes to set up.

BUCKET 1: FUTURE (12.5% of gross income)
↳ Retirement account (401k, IRA, or pension equivalent)
↳ This is one hour of your daily pay
↳ Money moves the same day your paycheck hits

BUCKET 2: SAFETY (5% of gross income)
↳ High-yield savings account
↳ This is your emergency fund
↳ Target: 3+ months of expenses

BUCKET 3: DREAMS (5% of gross income)
↳ Dedicated savings account
↳ For your house, wedding, education, vacation, or business
↳ Label the account so you know what you're building toward

Total: 22.5% of gross income.

"David, I can't save 22.5% right now."

Then start at 1%.

If you save 1% this month and increase by 1% each month, in 12 months you'll be saving 12% — four times what the average American saves.

And you won't even notice the difference.

The government doesn't ask you to budget to pay your taxes. They take them automatically.

Your savings should work the same way.

The full system is in The Automatic Millionaire (just updated). Link in comments.

## Post 6: THOUGHT LEADERSHIP — Making More Money Doesn't Make You Rich

**Hook Type:** Escalating income trap

---

Making more money doesn't make you rich.

I watched it happen to myself.

$50,000 a year → broke.
$75,000 a year → still broke. Spending more.
$100,000 a year → still spending more than I was making.

I was a financial adviser at Morgan Stanley. Helping OTHER people plan for retirement. And I couldn't save a dollar for myself.

Here's what the data shows:

When you take US households making $150,000 a year, 1 out of 3 of them are still broke.

Why? Lifestyle creep.

You get a raise, you upgrade your apartment. You get a bonus, you celebrate with a vacation. You start making real money, you start hanging around people spending real money.

And these phones are designed to get every dollar out of you. Better algorithms, one-click buying, subscription auto-renewals.

The battle for your income has never been more sophisticated.

The people who actually build wealth don't earn more than everyone else.

They automate before they can spend.

That's the difference between the McIntyres (net worth $1.8 million on $40K/year) and the six-figure earner with nothing in the bank.

It's never about income. It's always about the system.

## Post 7: FRAMEWORK/HOW-TO — The DOLP Debt Elimination System

**Hook Type:** Direct problem-solving + specific steps

---

If you're in credit card debt right now, here's the exact formula to get out.

It's called DOLP: Dead On Last Payment.

I used it myself when I was $12,000 in credit card debt out of college. I remember opening my bills and having the room spin.

Here's how it works:

STEP 1: List every debt, smallest balance to largest
(Don't worry about interest rates yet)

STEP 2: Set ALL minimum payments to automatic
Go online right now. Make every minimum payment automatic. You never miss a payment again.

STEP 3: Put ALL extra money toward the smallest debt
Every spare dollar attacks that smallest balance.

STEP 4: When smallest is paid off, don't close the account
(Closing it hurts your credit score)
Roll that entire payment to the next smallest debt.

STEP 5: Repeat until debt-free

Why smallest first instead of highest interest rate?

Because you need to see progress. When that first card hits zero, you feel it. That momentum carries you through the rest.

Then attack the interest rates. Negotiate lower rates. Look into balance transfers.

One more thing: when you finally get out of debt, DO NOT celebrate on the credit cards.

I did that. Got myself right back in the hole. Most people fall back at least twice.

After I got out the second time, I didn't carry a credit card for 30 years. Debit card only.

The full DOLP system (with worksheets) is in the updated Automatic Millionaire.

## Post 8: STORY-BASED — David's Near-Death Wake-Up Call

**Hook Type:** Vulnerable personal story + urgent lesson

---

Four years ago, my wife found me face down on the floor. Unconscious.

I was rushed to a hospital in Florence. Meningitis. I was in a coma for 4 days. Hospitalized for 17.

When I finally opened my eyes, the doctor asked if I knew my name.

"David."

"Your last name?"

"Bach."

"Do you know where you are?"

"Milan. I just had ankle surgery."

"No. You're in the ICU. We're treating you for meningitis."

They brought my wife in. "Do you know her name?"

I made a joke: "Rebecca?"

She screamed: "Who?!"

"Honey, I can still be a smartass in the hospital. It's Alatia."

But the truth is, I wasn't okay. The brain swelling meant I couldn't remember my passwords. My bank accounts. My phone. Nothing.

And I'd always been the one managing all our money.

When I got out, I did two things immediately:

1. Hired a financial adviser
2. Made sure my wife was involved in everything

Here's what I want you to hear:

If your partner died today, would they know where all the money is? The passwords? The accounts? The will?

6 out of 10 people don't have a will.
40% of couples can't identify how much their partner earns.

Run the fire drill. This weekend. Before there's a reason to.

The Automatic Millionaire has a full couples financial plan for exactly this.

## Post 9: THOUGHT LEADERSHIP — The 10-Year Window

**Hook Type:** Urgency + data-backed claim

---

I believe the next 10 years will be the greatest opportunity to build wealth in our lifetime.

And I also believe a lot of people are going to be left behind.

Here's why both things are true:

THE OPPORTUNITY:
→ AI is making companies more profitable than ever
→ Stock market up 600% in 20 years
→ Housing up 400% in 20 years
→ 24 million millionaires in the US (up 8 million in just 20 years)
→ VTI returned 14% annually over the last decade
→ QQQ returned 19% annually

THE DANGER:
→ 7 out of 10 Americans live paycheck to paycheck
→ 37% can't cover a $400 emergency
→ 41.5 million Americans receive food assistance at $6/day
→ Social Security is projected to be cut 20% by 2033
→ 60 million people depend on that $1,900/month check

Wealth is being created at a pace we've never seen.

The safety nets people are counting on are buckling.

No one is coming to save you. You're going to have to save yourself.

The question is: on which side of this divide will you be in 10 years?

The system to get on the right side takes 10 minutes to set up. It's in The Automatic Millionaire.

## Post 10: CONTRARIAN — Boring Is Beautiful

**Hook Type:** Direct challenge to dominant culture

---

Your TikTok feed is full of people trading meme coins and options.

They're going to be broke forever.

I know that sounds harsh. After 33 years in finance, I've earned the right to say it.

People who try to get rich quick stay broke forever.

My son asked me last week: "Dad, why aren't you trading Tesla stock?"

"Because you can't make money trading. You've got to figure out when to buy, when to sell. I want you in index funds."

Here's what actually builds wealth:

→ VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market): 14% annual returns, 10 years
→ QQQ (NASDAQ 100): 19% annual returns, 480% total in 10 years
→ Vanguard Balanced Fund: 8%+ annually since inception

Boring. Automatic. Monthly. For decades.

That's how 654,000 Fidelity 401k participants became millionaires.

Not from trading. Not from timing the market. Not from a hot tip on social media.

From setting up an automatic transfer and never touching it.

Your investments should be boring. Your life should be interesting.

If someone's at a cocktail party talking about their investments and it's exciting, something's wrong.

Sexy is how you go broke. Boring is how you build wealth.

The Automatic Millionaire is the boring system that works. Updated for 2026 with current fund recommendations and 20 years of proof.
