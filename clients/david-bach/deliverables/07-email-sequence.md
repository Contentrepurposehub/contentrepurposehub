### Email 1: Score Delivery + System Introduction

**Send timing:** Day 0 (immediately after scorecard completion)
**Subject line:** Your Wealth Automation Score + the system behind it
**Preview text:** Here's what your score means — and the exact formula to improve it.
**From:** David Bach
**CTA:** Watch the full Diary of a CEO episode

Hey,

You just took the Wealth Automation Scorecard. Here's what that means.

Whatever your score — whether you're in Manual Mode or already running the full system — the fact that you took 2 minutes to measure it puts you ahead of most people. Because most people don't even know there's a formula.

**There is a formula.**

There are now 654,000 people in Fidelity 401k plans who are millionaires. All-time record. They all followed the same system:

→ Save 14% of gross income (plus employer match)
→ Invest 70% stocks / 30% bonds
→ Automate the transfer on payday

Three numbers. That's the whole formula.

I broke down every piece of it — every percentage, every account, the stories of real people who used this starting from zero — in my recent conversation with Steven Bartlett on the Diary of a CEO.

It's 90 minutes. And I genuinely believe it could change how you think about money.

Here's what we cover:

- Why making more money doesn't make you rich (1 in 3 at $150K are broke)
- The government's trick that makes taxes always get paid — and how to use it for wealth
- The two escalators where ALL wealth is created ($80 trillion in proof)
- Why homeowners are worth 40x more than renters
- The couple who retired at 52 with $1.8 million on a $40K salary

Over the next few days, I'll send you two more emails breaking down the pieces of the system that move the needle most.

For now, watch the episode. It's the most complete version of the formula I've ever shared publicly.

### Email 2: The First Hour Deep Dive

**Send timing:** Day 2
**Subject line:** The first hour of your income (this changes everything)
**Preview text:** The government figured this out decades ago. Here's how to use their trick.
**From:** David Bach
**CTA:** Watch the full Diary of a CEO episode

Here's an insight that changes everything once you see it.

The government doesn't ask you to budget to pay taxes.

They don't send you a bill at the end of the month and hope you have enough left. They take your taxes automatically, before you ever see the money.

That's why taxes always get paid.

**Your wealth system needs to work the same way.**

Whatever you earn, the first hour of your income goes to YOU. Not the landlord. Not Amazon. Not the credit card company. You.

The first hour of an 8-hour workday = 12.5% of your gross income.

If you earn $60,000/year:
→ 12.5% = $7,500/year
→ That's $625/month
→ Moved automatically on payday

The average American saves 3-5%. That's about 24 minutes of their workday going to their future self. Then they wonder why they can't retire.

The 654,000 401k millionaires? They saved the first hour. Every single workday. Automatically.

**Here's how to set it up (takes about 15 minutes):**

1. Calculate 12.5% of your gross income
2. Log into your 401k (or open an IRA if you don't have one)
3. Set the contribution to 12.5% — or whatever you can start with
4. Make sure it auto-drafts on payday
5. If your employer matches, contribute at least enough to get the full match

Can't do 12.5% right now? Start at 3%. Set it to increase by 1% every six months. You won't feel the increases. Your lifestyle adjusts. Within 3-5 years, you'll be at the target.

The key: it has to be automatic. The money moves before you see it. Before you can spend it. Before the algorithms on your phone get to your wallet.

I explain the full system — including why 70/30 stocks-to-bonds is the allocation and what the three accounts are — in my Diary of a CEO conversation with Steven Bartlett.

Not budgeting. Not discipline. A machine.

P.S. In my next email, I'm going to tell you about a couple who earned $40,000 a year and retired millionaires. Their story is the most powerful proof I've ever seen that this formula works at ANY income level.

### Email 3: The McIntyres Story + Final Push

**Send timing:** Day 5
**Subject line:** They earned $40K/year and retired with $1.8 million
**Preview text:** No inheritance. No stock options. No six-figure salary. Ever. Here's what they did.
**From:** David Bach
**CTA:** Watch the full Diary of a CEO episode

I want to tell you about Jim and Sue McIntyre.

They lived in San Leandro, California. Average income: $40,000 a year. Their entire working lives.

Not $400,000. $40,000.

Here's what they did:

→ Bought a house on their street
→ Bought a SECOND house on the same street
→ Paid both off over time — one to live in, one for rental income
→ Contributed to their 401k every paycheck
→ Automated everything

At 52, they retired with $1.8 million in net worth.

No inheritance. No stock options. No lucky break. No six-figure salary. Ever.

They got on both escalators — stocks AND real estate — and let the system run.

**Here's why their story matters to you:**

There are 24 million millionaires in America right now. Up 8 million in the last 20 years. Most of them look a lot more like the McIntyres than like a tech founder.

The formula isn't complicated:

1. Automate 14% of gross income into your 401k
2. Invest 70% stocks / 30% bonds
3. Get on the real estate escalator (even a small starter home)
4. Don't touch it. Let compound interest do the heavy lifting.

The McIntyres didn't have special knowledge. They had a system. And they ran it for 25 years.

I told their full story — along with the complete formula and the real-world data behind it — in my conversation with Steven Bartlett on the Diary of a CEO.

If you haven't watched it yet, this is my strongest recommendation: **watch it this week.** It's 90 minutes that could genuinely change your financial trajectory.

We know for a fact that the formula works. 654,000 401k millionaires prove it. The McIntyres prove it. $80 trillion in stocks and real estate prove it.

The only question is whether your system is running.

If it's not — start today. Automate your first hour. Get on an escalator. Let the machine work.
