## Key Frameworks (Proprietary / Teachable)

### 1. The Latte Factor
- $27.40/day = $10,000/year
- $10,000/year invested at 10% for 40 years = $4,424,000
- Core insight: We waste small amounts unconsciously every day
- Not just about coffee — subscriptions, lunches, cocktails, impulse buys

### 2. Pay Yourself First (One Hour a Day)
- 12.5% of gross income → retirement account (first hour)
- 5% → emergency account (half of second hour)
- 5% → dream account (other half of second hour)
- Total: ~22.5% of gross income across three buckets
- Start at 1% if you can't do 12.5% — increase 1% per month for a year

### 3. The Three Bucket System
- **Bucket 1: Future** — Retirement (401k, IRA, pension equivalent)
- **Bucket 2: Safety** — Emergency fund
- **Bucket 3: Dreams** — House down payment, wedding, vacation, education, business

### 4. DOLP (Dead On Last Payment)
- List all credit cards smallest balance to largest
- Make minimum automatic payments on all cards
- Put ALL extra money toward smallest balance
- When smallest is paid off, roll that payment to next smallest
- Don't close paid-off accounts (protects credit score)
- Then attack interest rates — negotiate lower, balance transfer (carefully)

### 5. The 70/30 Allocation (Millionaire Formula)
- 401k millionaires saved 14% of gross income
- Employer matched on top
- Invested 70% stocks / 30% bonds
- Average American only saves 3-5%

### 6. Bi-Weekly Mortgage Payoff
- Split mortgage payment in half, pay every two weeks
- OR make one extra payment per year
- OR increase monthly payment by 10%
- Saves $50K-$100K in interest; pays off 30-year mortgage 5-7 years early

### 7. The $10/Day for 100 Days Challenge
- For people truly struggling
- Save $10/day for 100 days = $1,000
- More than 50% of Americans have in savings
- Builds the savings muscle

### 8. The Subscription Audit
- Go to phone Settings → Subscriptions
- Cancel everything you don't actively use
- When signing up for anything new, cancel immediately (you keep access through the period, they'll offer a better deal at renewal)
- Could find $50-$200/month instantly
