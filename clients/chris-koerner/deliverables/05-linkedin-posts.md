## Post 1: Story — The $2.13/Hour House

**Hook:** I bought my first house making $2.13 an hour.

Not a typo. Two dollars and thirteen cents. The federal tipped minimum wage.

It was 2008. I'd just gotten married, moved to Alabama, and was waiting tables at a Thai restaurant. We were broke college students with no business buying a house.

We found one on Zillow. 1805 21st Avenue East. $90,000.

Everyone told us the timing was terrible. Middle of the worst financial crisis in a generation. Banks were collapsing. The housing market was in free fall.

We bought it anyway. 3.5% down using government grants and savings from my serving job.

Sometimes ignorance is a superpower.

We didn't know we weren't supposed to be able to buy a house as broke college students. So we just kept talking to bankers until one said yes.

9 months later, the Obama first-time homebuyer tax credit hit our mailbox. $8,000 check. We used it as a down payment on a rental property 5 minutes away.

Still broke. Still making $2.13/hour. But we owned two homes.

That was 17 years ago. I've since started and sold five 7-8 figure companies. But every single one traces back to that moment — two broke kids who moved before they were ready.

Your starting point isn't your ceiling. It's your first deal.

## Post 2: Thought Leadership — Constraints Equal Creativity

**Hook:** Stop waiting until you "have enough money" to start.

The waiting is the mistake.

I've been buying real estate for 17 years. Bought and sold five 7-8 figure companies. And the best deals I've ever done started with the same problem: I didn't have the capital.

Here's what I've learned: constraints equal creativity.

When you don't have money, you can't rely on a fat down payment or perfect credit to carry the deal. You're forced to ask better questions:

— What does the seller actually want?
— What's flexible in the structure?
— Can I remove risk instead of adding cash?
— Can I change the timeline instead of the price?

Those are better questions than "how do I get a bigger loan."

Bootstrapped startups have statistically the same success rate as venture-funded ones. VC doesn't make you better at building. It makes you worse at being creative.

Same principle applies to buying a business, a property, a franchise. The people who move with nothing are forced to develop the one skill that actually matters: structuring deals that work for both sides.

The people who wait until they "have enough" never learn that skill. And when they finally deploy capital, they overpay because they never had to get creative.

Having no money isn't your problem. It's your biggest unfair advantage. You just don't know it yet.

## Post 3: Framework — The Mom vs. Stranger Spectrum

**Hook:** Every seller starts as a stranger. Your job is to turn them into family.

Here's the framework I use on every deal:

If you needed $1,000 right now — urgently — would you ask your mom or a random stranger on the street?

Your mom. Obviously.

Why? Because she trusts you. She knows your character. She's seen your track record. She believes you'll pay her back.

Now think about seller financing. You're asking someone to let you buy their business or property with little money down. That's a big ask.

If they see you as a stranger, the answer is no. Every time.

If they see you closer to "family" on the trust spectrum, the answer changes. Maybe not to yes — but to "let's talk about how this could work."

Here's how you move the needle:

1. Visit in person. Not a phone call. Not an email. Show up.
2. Bring your family. Let them see you're a real person with a real life.
3. Share your story honestly. Why this deal matters to you.
4. Acknowledge their expertise. They built this thing. Respect that.
5. Follow up consistently. Most people disappear after the first "no."
6. Offer value before asking for terms. Can you solve a problem they have?

Even moving a seller from 1% to 15% chance of saying yes changes everything. That's the difference between "not a chance" and "tell me more about the structure."

This works whether the deal is $50,000 or $5 million. The math changes. The principle doesn't.

## Post 4: Story — The PMI Negotiation

**Hook:** The bank told me I had to pay $160/month extra. I said no.

When my wife and I bought that first house in 2008, the bank quoted us $535/month for the mortgage. Fine. We could make that work on our waiter wages.

Then they added PMI — private mortgage insurance. Bumped it to $700/month. An extra $160/month because we didn't have 20% down.

I'd been reading everything I could about real estate. I knew PMI was standard on low-down-payment loans. But I also read that it wasn't the only option.

So I told the banker: "No. I'm not paying that. I read that I don't have to."

They said it's required. It's not going to work without it.

I said okay, then I'll find another bank.

Guess what? Magically, there were other loan products available. 3.5% down. No PMI.

Here's what nobody tells you: many loans require PMI, but almost all banks have loan products that don't. They just don't want to give you those options. Because PMI is profitable for them.

If a bank has to choose between losing your business entirely and giving you a less profitable loan, they're going to give you the loan you want.

We owned that house for 11 years. Rented it out for 9 of those. It cash-flowed the entire time.

All because I was willing to hear "no" and keep pushing.

Ask for what you want. The worst they can say is no. And even then, it's usually just the first no.

## Post 5: Framework — My Price Your Terms / Your Price My Terms

**Hook:** The best negotiation framework I know fits in one sentence.

My price, your terms. Or your price, my terms.

Pick one.

Here's what this means in practice:

If the seller won't move on price — fine. Negotiate the terms. Push out the timeline. Lower the down payment. Restructure the interest rate. Add a graduated payment schedule.

If the seller won't move on terms — fine. Negotiate the price. Get a discount for accepting their rigid structure.

What most people do wrong: they try to win on BOTH price AND terms. That's how deals die. The seller feels squeezed and walks.

Real example: I looked at a $200K landscaping business. The seller wanted full price. Non-starter for me to pay that upfront.

So I said: your price. My terms. I'll pay $200K, but I'll do it at $5K/month from the business's own profits. No big lump sum. Graduated payments.

The seller got his price. I got my terms. The deal closed.

I later sold that business for $600K. The balloon payment never came due.

The reason this works: sellers care about different things than you think. Some care about the final number (ego, taxes, estate planning). Some care about the monthly income. Some care about timeline. Some care about certainty.

Figure out which lever matters to them. Then negotiate the others.

It should only be math to you. Not ego. Not emotion. Math.

## Post 6: Thought Leadership — Fall in Love With the Asset Class

**Hook:** The moment you fall in love with one specific property, you've already lost the negotiation.

I see this constantly.

Someone finds a business or a property they want. They start imagining themselves running it. They tell their spouse. They name it in their head. They picture the renovations.

And then when the seller throws out bad terms or an inflated price, they accept it. Because they're emotionally locked in.

Here's my rule: fall in love with an asset class, not a specific asset.

I love RV and mobile home parks. I've been buying them for 7 years. I own an RV park in Waco. I'm a GP in a PE fund acquiring 1-3 parks per month.

But I have never been emotionally attached to a single property. Not one.

Because emotional attachment is where every mistake happens:
— You overpay because you "have to have it"
— You accept bad terms because you can't imagine walking away
— You stop comparing it against other opportunities
— You negotiate from desperation instead of strength

It should only be math to you.

Be flexible on geography. Be flexible on size. Be flexible on price point. Be rigid on the math working.

There are always more deals. There is always another property. The one you're looking at right now is not special. The asset class is what matters.

You've got to be willing to walk from any deal at any time. That willingness is the most powerful negotiating tool you'll ever have.

## Post 7: Framework — The Master Lease Structure

**Hook:** I structured a deal on a $2 million RV park with $0 down. Here's how.

This is the master lease. One of my favorite deal structures.

The setup: RV park in Louisiana. Listed for $2M. On the market for 2 years. Collecting $12K/month in rents but needed massive work to hit its real potential — $23M value at full occupancy.

The seller was tired. Nobody was buying. The property needed work he didn't want to do.

Here's what I proposed:

I lease the property for $7,000/month (below the $12K gross rents, giving me cash flow to improve it). 2-year lease term. Option to purchase at $3-4M — a 50%+ premium over asking.

No down payment. No bank. No loan application.

Why the seller said yes:

Worst case for him — I pay $7K/month for 2 years ($168K total income), then walk away. He gets the property back, plus the improvements I made, plus the $168K. He's better off than before.

Best case for him — I buy at $3-4M. That's $1-2M more than he was asking. And he got income the whole time.

Worst case for me — I lease a cash-flowing property, learn the operations, and walk away if the numbers don't work.

This is what I mean by structuring deals where the worst case is still a win for both sides.

The master lease is underused because most people don't know it exists. Now you do.

## Post 8: Thought Leadership — Document the Journey Before You Need the Money

**Hook:** A guy with zero followers and an iPhone raised enough money to build a $7 million property.

Isaac French built Live Oak Lake — 7 Scandinavian-style cabins outside Waco, Texas. Shipped building kits from overseas, dug out a pond, 5-10 acres with mature oaks.

Total build cost: $1.5-2M. Sold 2 years later for $7-8M.

But here's the part most people miss: he didn't start with the money. He started with the story.

A friend of Isaac's wanted to replicate the model. Had no money. No audience. No track record.

So he picked up his iPhone and started an Instagram account. Zero followers. No fancy editing. No production team. Just talking to the camera about what he was planning to build.

He documented the dream. The process. The setbacks. The progress.

By the time he was ready to launch, he had 130,000 followers. Investors reached out to HIM. First customers were already lined up.

This is an asymmetric bet. Low downside — some time and effort. Massive upside — customers, investors, credibility, deal flow.

Your story could be worth thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. But only if you tell it.

Most people won't do this because they're afraid of looking stupid before they've succeeded. Shed your ego. Shed your pride. The people who document publicly before they've "made it" are the ones who get funded fastest.

The platforms are free. The phone is in your pocket. The only cost is the willingness to start before you're ready.

## Post 9: Thought Leadership — Everything Is Figureoutable

**Hook:** A floor plug taught me the most important lesson in deal-making.

I'm building a custom house right now. My dream home. And in the middle of the design process, I realized I wanted a floor plug in my home office for my MacBook charger.

The problem: we were past that stage of the build. Electrical was done. Floor plan locked.

I asked my builder if it was possible.

His response: "We can reverse, change, fix, add, anything at any stage in the build process. Literally, anything can be fixed or changed. The only question is how much are you willing to pay."

I think about that quote constantly.

Because it applies to every deal structure, every negotiation, every business acquisition.

The question is never "can this be done?" The question is always "what am I willing to negotiate to make it work?"

Seller won't take zero down? What if you change the interest rate?
Bank won't approve the loan? What if you bring a partial seller carryback?
Timeline doesn't work? What if you structure a graduated payment plan?
Price is too high? What if you offer shared appreciation on the upside?

Everything is figureoutable. Everything can be restructured. Every "no" is just the starting position for a different conversation.

The people who acquire assets aren't smarter than you. They just don't accept the first version of the deal as final.

## Post 10: Contrarian — Stop Raising Money

**Hook:** Raising capital is making you a worse entrepreneur.

I know that's not what you want to hear. But I've started and sold five 7-8 figure companies across five industries, and here's what I've seen:

The people who raise money first almost always underperform the people who figure it out with nothing.

Why?

Because capital removes the need to be creative.

When you have a $500K war chest, you don't need to call the seller and have an uncomfortable conversation about financing. You just write the check. Easy.

But "easy" doesn't build the skill set that compounds for the rest of your career.

When I bought an $800,000 business for $50,000 down, I didn't have a choice. I had to understand seller financing structures. I had to learn graduated payments, partial carrybacks, master leases. I had to build relationships with sellers until they trusted me enough to carry the note.

Those skills are now worth millions to me. I use them on every deal. They never depreciate.

The person who raised $500K and wrote a check? They learned how to write a check. That's it.

Bootstrapped startups have statistically the same success rate as venture-funded ones. Let that sink in. Same success rate. But the bootstrapped founders come out the other side with a completely different skill set.

Constraints equal creativity. And creativity is the only asset that appreciates every time you use it.

Don't raise money. Raise your standards for how creatively you structure deals.
