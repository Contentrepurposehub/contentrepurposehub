You can buy a business with no money down. I've done it. I bought an $800,000 business for $50,000 down, bought my first house at 21 while making $2.13 an hour waiting tables, and structured a master lease on a $2 million RV park for $7,000 a month. None of these deals required me to show up with a bag of cash. Every single one required me to show up with a better question than "what's the price?"

The short answer: seller financing is your best shot at buying something big with little money. Preferably as close to 100% seller-financed as possible. Yes, 100% seller financing is very possible. But if someone tells you it happens all the time, they're lying. The real answer is more useful than the short answer -- it's 10 specific deal structures, each with real numbers, real risks, and real examples from deals I've personally done or been directly involved in.

This isn't going to be generic. If you're looking for an article that says "have you heard of seller financing?" and then tells you to go talk to a bank, close this tab. I'm going to walk you through every creative financing structure I've used across 17 years of buying real estate and businesses, with the actual dollar amounts, the actual conversations I had with sellers, and the actual risks I was taking.

A, I grew up poor. B, I'm cheap. And if I do a whole bunch of research and conclude something isn't as risky as it looks from the outside, I'm going to take the swing. That's what this article is about -- giving you the same playbook.

## Why "No Money" Is Actually Your Starting Advantage

One of the questions I get most often is: "Chris, I want to buy a business but I don't have any money."

And you know what I would say to that? Good.

Constraints equal creativity. When you don't have a pile of cash to throw at a deal, you're forced to ask better questions. Instead of "what's the down payment?" you start asking:

- Can I remove some risk instead of adding cash?
- Can I change the timeline instead of the price?
- Can I change the terms instead of the price?
- What does the seller actually need -- is it cash, or is it certainty?

These are the questions that get deals done. And you only learn to ask them when you don't have the lazy option of just writing a check.

Bootstrapped startups have statistically the same success rate as venture-funded ones. The people who figure out how to buy things without money develop a skill set that the people who lead with capital never build. Being broke isn't your problem. It's your training program.

## The Relationship Framework That Makes Everything Else Work

Before I walk through the 10 structures, you need to understand the one thing that matters more than any financing trick: trust.

I call it the Mom vs. Stranger Spectrum.

If you needed $1,000 right now, you'd ask your mom. Not a stranger on the street. Why? Because your mom knows you. She trusts you. She's seen your track record. She believes you'll pay it back.

A seller starts as a stranger. Your job -- the entire game -- is to move them closer to the "mom" end of that spectrum. Not all the way. You don't need to be their kid. But even moving from a 1% chance of "yes" to a 10-20% chance changes everything.

How do you do that?

- **Visit in person.** Don't email an LOI to someone who's never met you. Drive to the property. Shake their hand. Bring your wife. Bring your kids if you have them. People sell to people they like and trust, not to email addresses.
- **Share your story.** Your background, your plan, why you want this specific asset. Not a pitch deck -- your actual story.
- **Acknowledge their expertise.** They built this thing. They know it better than you. Asking questions about their experience isn't weakness -- it's the fastest way to build trust.
- **Follow up.** Most buyers disappear after the first conversation. The ones who follow up with a thoughtful note, a question, a piece of information -- those are the ones who get seller financing.

This works whether it's a $90,000 house or a $2 million business. The dollar amount changes. The human dynamics don't.

Now let me walk you through the 10 structures.

## 10 Seller Financing Structures to Buy a Business or Property With Little or No Money

### 1. Balloon Payment

**How it works:** You put little or nothing down and make small monthly payments for a set period (usually 2-5 years). At the end of that period, a large "balloon" payment is due for the remaining balance.

**Real example:** A landscaping business listed at $200,000. You put nothing down, pay $5,000 a month from the business's own profits, and have a balloon payment due in 2 years. But here's the play -- you grow the business, sell it for $600,000 in 18 months, and the balloon never comes due because you've already cashed out.

**Best for:** Businesses or properties you plan to improve and sell (or refinance with a bank once you have a track record of income). The small monthly payments let you prove the asset works before you're on the hook for the big number.

**Risk to know about:** If you can't refinance or sell before the balloon comes due, you're in trouble. Never sign a balloon structure without a realistic exit plan and enough time to execute it.

---

### 2. Interest-Only Payments

**How it works:** You pay only the interest on the loan for a set period. No principal reduction. Your monthly payment is significantly lower than a traditional amortizing loan.

**Best for:** Assets with tight cash flow in the early months. An RV park that needs occupancy improvements, a business that needs 6-12 months to stabilize. The lower payment gives you breathing room.

**Risk to know about:** The principal isn't shrinking. You still owe the full amount. And depending on the structure, the note eventually comes due. This is a tool for buying time, not a permanent solution.

---

### 3. Graduated Payments

**How it works:** Your payments start very small and increase over time on a predetermined schedule. Month one might be $500. Six months later it's $700. A year in, it's $1,000. Two years in, it's $2,000.

**Why this is better than a payment holiday:** A lot of people negotiate 6 months of zero payments. That sounds great on paper. But here's what actually happens -- the seller sits there for 6 months getting nothing, wondering if you're ever going to pay. By month 4, they're anxious. By month 5, they're thinking about calling a lawyer.

Graduated payments solve this. The seller gets a check from day one. Even if it's $500, it does something powerful: it proves you're legitimate. It builds trust month after month. And it lets your cash flow grow into the payment schedule instead of hitting you with the full amount before the business can support it.

**Best for:** Any acquisition where revenue will grow over time but isn't there yet on day one.

---

### 4. Partial Seller Carryback

**How it works:** You combine traditional bank financing with a seller-held note. The bank covers most of it, the seller carries a chunk as a second lien, and you bring whatever's left.

**Real example:** My best friend bought a $2.2 million business. SBA loan covered about 80%. The seller held 10% as a note. He put 10% down -- roughly $200,000 -- which came from his savings, a small investment from me, and contributions from friends and family.

That's three funding sources layered together: bank, seller, and personal network. No single source covered the deal. But combined, they got it done.

**Best for:** Larger acquisitions where the bank likes the deal but wants more down payment than you have. The seller carryback fills the gap between what the bank will lend and what you can bring to the table. SBA loans are particularly good for this -- the SBA is often comfortable with the seller holding a piece.

**Risk to know about:** The seller is now your lender AND your former business partner's advocate. If you run the business into the ground, they lose twice -- their note and their legacy. This means you need to genuinely run the business well, not just make minimum payments.

---

### 5. Shared Appreciation Mortgage

**How it works:** Instead of paying a higher price today, you give the seller a percentage of the future upside. They get a smaller down payment (or none), lower monthly payments, and a cut of the profits when you sell or refinance.

**How to pitch it:** Here's the conversation. The seller says the business could be worth $3 million in 5 years. Great. Use their own optimism. "You think it's going to $3 million? Perfect -- give me better terms today, and I'll cut you into those future profits. If you're right about the upside, you'll make more money with this structure than you would selling to me at full price right now."

**Best for:** Sellers who believe in the future value of their asset but need to sell now. Also works well when the seller plans to stay involved in some capacity -- they now have a financial incentive to help you succeed.

**Risk to know about:** You're giving up a piece of the upside. If the property or business appreciates significantly, that percentage could cost you more than a traditional purchase price would have. Run the numbers both ways before you commit.

---

### 6. Lease to Own / Master Lease

**How it works:** You lease the asset (business, property, equipment) with an option to purchase at a predetermined price after a set period. You're operating the asset and keeping the profits, but you don't own it yet.

**Real example:** A $2 million RV park in Louisiana. It had been listed for sale for 2 years with no takers. Current gross rents were $12,000 a month. I negotiated a master lease at $7,000 a month for 2 years, with an option to buy at $3-4 million.

Here's why the seller said yes: worst case, they collect $7,000 a month for 24 months ($168,000 total), then get their property back in the same or better condition. They're no worse off. Best case, I exercise the option and buy at a 50-100% premium to what they were asking -- and the property is worth considerably more because I've improved occupancy and operations.

At 90% occupancy, that park could be worth $23 million. The gap between the $2 million asking price and $23 million potential value is why this deal structure exists.

**Best for:** Properties or businesses that need significant operational improvement. The lease period is your runway to prove the concept, increase value, and secure traditional financing for the purchase. Also works when sellers are tired -- a property that's been listed for 2 years has a seller who's ready for creative solutions.

**Risk to know about:** You're spending money and effort improving an asset you don't own yet. If you can't or don't exercise the purchase option, the seller gets a better property and you get nothing. Make sure the option terms are airtight and the purchase price is locked.

---

### 7. Zero Down / 100% Seller Financing

**How it works:** The seller finances the entire purchase price. No down payment. You compensate them with a higher interest rate, a higher purchase price, or both.

**The negotiation:** They want 5% interest and 10% down? Offer 8% interest and 0% down. You're trading cash today for cost over time. The seller gets a higher return on their money. You get in the door without capital.

**A practical tip:** Use ChatGPT or a spreadsheet to model different structures before the conversation. "Here's what you'd receive at 5% with 10% down over 7 years. Here's what you'd receive at 8% with 0% down over 7 years. You actually make $47,000 more with the second structure." When you can show the seller they make more money by giving you better terms, the conversation changes completely.

**Best for:** Smaller businesses ($100K-$500K) where the seller is the sole owner and has the flexibility to negotiate directly. Larger deals with multiple stakeholders or board approvals are harder to get to 100%.

**Risk to know about:** Your monthly payment is higher, and you're fully leveraged from day one. If the business hits a rough patch in month 3, there's no equity cushion. This structure demands that the business cash-flows from the start.

---

### 8. Asset Swap / Services in Lieu

**How it works:** Instead of cash for the down payment, you offer something else of value -- consulting services, marketing work, another asset you own (vehicle, equipment, real estate), or a combination.

**Example scenario:** You run a marketing agency. The seller needs help transitioning to retirement and wants their brand legacy maintained. You offer 6 months of marketing services (worth $30,000) plus $20,000 in cash instead of $50,000 cash. The seller gets more total value, and you preserve your capital.

**Best for:** Situations where you have skills or assets the seller actually needs. This only works when the trade is genuine, not when you're trying to substitute a $5,000 service for a $50,000 down payment. The value has to be real and the seller has to want it.

---

### 9. Subject to Existing Debt (Sub-2)

**How it works:** You take over the seller's existing loan payments. The debt stays in the seller's name, but you're making the payments and controlling the asset.

**When it works:** The property has a low-interest loan the seller wants out from under. They're tired of managing it. They've moved on. They'd rather hand you the keys and stop making payments than go through the hassle of selling traditionally.

**Best for:** Real estate where the existing debt is favorable (low interest rate, good terms) and the seller's primary motivation is relief, not maximum price.

**Risk to know about:** The loan has a "due on sale" clause -- technically, the bank can call the note when ownership transfers. In practice, this rarely happens if payments are current. But it's a real risk, and you need to understand it going in. This is not a beginner's structure.

---

### 10. Delayed Down Payment

**How it works:** You agree to a down payment, but you don't pay it now. You pay it 12-24 months from now, after the business or property has had time to generate the cash.

**Why sellers agree:** They're in first lien position. If you don't pay, they take the asset back. They haven't lost anything. Meanwhile, they're collecting monthly payments from day one. And you've been improving the asset for 12-24 months, which means it's worth more than when they sold it to you.

**Best for:** Deals where you're confident the asset will generate enough cash to fund the down payment within the delayed period. Common in business acquisitions where the business throws off strong cash flow but the buyer doesn't have liquid savings.

## The Framework That Ties It All Together

When you're sitting across from a seller and you don't have much capital, remember this:

**My price, your terms. Or your price, my terms.**

If the seller won't budge on price, negotiate terms -- the timeline, the structure, the interest rate, the down payment. If the seller won't budge on terms, negotiate price.

Every deal has two dials: price and terms. Most buyers only touch one. When you learn to work both, you find deals that looked impossible from the outside.

And keep this in mind: **it should only be math to you.** Don't get emotionally attached. The moment you fall in love with a specific property or business, you've already lost the negotiation. Fall in love with an asset class, not a specific asset. Be flexible on geography, size, and price point. Be willing to walk from any deal at any time.

## Proof It Works: How I Bought My First House Making $2.13 an Hour

Let me tell you a couple stories so you know this isn't theoretical.

In 2008, I was 21 years old. Just married. Moved to Alabama. Broke college student waiting tables at a Thai restaurant for $2.13 an hour plus tips.

My wife and I started looking on Zillow -- because that's what you do when you're young and don't know what you don't know. We found a house at 1805 21st Avenue East. Price: $90,000. We bought it with 3.5% down using a combination of government grants and savings from the serving job.

Sometimes ignorance is a superpower. We didn't know we weren't supposed to be able to buy a house as broke college students in the middle of the worst financial crisis in a generation. So we just kept talking to bankers until we found one that said yes.

But here's the part nobody talks about. The bank wanted $535 a month for the mortgage. But with PMI -- private mortgage insurance, which is what banks charge when you put less than 20% down -- the payment jumped to $700 a month. That's $160 a month extra. For insurance that protects the bank, not you.

I said no.

The banker said "it's not going to work." I said I'd read that PMI wasn't required on every loan product, and I wasn't paying it. Guess what? Magically, there were other options. Because here's what nobody tells you about PMI: many loans require it, but almost all banks have loan products that don't. They just don't want to give you those options. If they have to choose between losing your business entirely and giving you a less profitable loan, they're going to give you the loan you want. You just have to ask.

We owned that house for 11 years. Rented it for 9 of those.

And 9 months later, an $8,000 check showed up in the mail -- Obama's first-time homebuyer tax credit. We used that $8,000 as the down payment on a rental home 5 minutes away.

Still broke college students. Still making $2.13 an hour. But we owned two homes.

That's what "constraints equal creativity" looks like in practice. Not a poster on the wall. Two houses.

## The Social Media Strategy That Replaces Capital

Here's one more approach that doesn't cost a dollar.

Isaac French built Live Oak Lake -- 7 Scandinavian-style cabins outside Waco, Texas. Shipped building kits from overseas, dug out a pond, 5-10 acres with mature oaks. Total cost: $1.5-2 million. Sold 2 years later for $7-8 million. One deal, 2-3 years of work, life-changing money.

He had very little going in. But he had a camera.

A friend of Isaac's wanted to do something similar. No money. No investors. No track record. So he started an Instagram account with zero followers and documented the entire process with his iPhone. No fancy editing. No fancy equipment. Just talking to the camera about what he was building, what he was learning, and what was going wrong.

By the time he was ready to launch, he had 130,000 followers. Investors were reaching out to him. Customers were already lined up. The audience became the capital.

This is an asymmetric bet. The downside is some time. The upside is customers, investors, credibility, and deal flow. Your story could be worth thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. Sell your story before you need to sell your product.

## What to Do This Week (Not This Year)

I'm not going to end this with some motivational "go change your life" nonsense. Here's what to do in the next 7 days:

1. **Pick your asset class.** Business, real estate, RV park, laundromat -- whatever. Fall in love with the category, not a specific asset.
2. **Find 5 listings.** BizBuySell, Loopnet, Facebook Marketplace, local brokers. Doesn't matter. Get 5 things in front of you.
3. **Model one deal with seller financing.** Pick the most interesting listing and run the numbers using 3 different structures from this article. Use a spreadsheet or ChatGPT.
4. **Make one phone call.** Call the seller or broker. Don't pitch. Ask questions. Learn what they actually want. Start moving from "stranger" toward "mom" on the trust spectrum.
5. **Start documenting.** Post on LinkedIn, X, Instagram, or YouTube. Talk about what you're learning. Your audience will find you.

You don't need more money. You need a different conversation with the seller.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you really buy a business with no money down?

Yes. 100% seller financing is real and I've personally structured deals at or near zero down. I bought an $800,000 business for $50,000 down and structured a master lease on a $2 million RV park for $7,000 a month with no purchase money upfront. The key is seller financing -- trading higher interest rates, profit-sharing, or future payments for lower or zero down payments. It doesn't happen on every deal, but it happens often enough that "I don't have money" is not a valid reason to stop looking.

### What is seller financing and how does it work?

Seller financing means the person selling the business or property acts as the bank. Instead of getting all their money at closing from a traditional lender, they let you pay them over time -- monthly payments, a balloon payment, or some combination. The seller holds a note (basically an IOU with terms) secured by the asset. If you stop paying, they take the asset back. This removes the bank from the equation entirely, which means no credit score requirements, no 20% down payment mandates, and much more flexible terms.

### How do I convince a seller to offer financing?

Build the relationship first. Visit in person, share your story, acknowledge their expertise, and follow up consistently. Then use the "my price, your terms / your price, my terms" framework. Show the seller that creative terms actually make them more money. For example: "At 5% interest with 10% down, you receive $X over 7 years. At 8% interest with 0% down, you receive $X + $47,000 over the same period." When the math favors the seller, the conversation shifts from "will they say yes" to "which structure do they prefer."

### Is seller financing risky for the buyer?

Every deal structure has risk. The risk with seller financing is that you're often more leveraged than a traditional purchase -- higher interest rates, balloon payments, or full principal still owed. The way to manage this: never sign a structure without modeling the worst case. For a balloon payment, what happens if you can't refinance? For a master lease, what happens if occupancy doesn't improve? Bracket the downside before you commit. The risk isn't in the structure -- it's in not understanding the structure before you sign.

### What is a master lease and when should I use one?

A master lease means you lease an asset (usually real estate) with an option to buy it at a predetermined price after a set period. You operate the asset and keep the profits, but you don't own it yet. Use this when a property is underperforming and needs operational improvements that will increase its value. I used a master lease on a $2 million Louisiana RV park -- $7,000/month for 2 years with an option to buy at $3-4 million. The seller's worst case was collecting $168,000 and getting a better property back. My best case was buying a park worth $23 million at full occupancy for a fraction of that.

### Can I combine multiple financing sources for one deal?

Absolutely. My best friend bought a $2.2 million business using three sources: an SBA loan for about 80%, the seller holding 10% as a second lien note, and 10% down ($200,000) from his savings plus investments from friends and family (including me). Layering funding sources is common and often necessary for larger deals. The SBA is particularly comfortable with partial seller carryback structures.

### How do I find businesses for sale that would accept seller financing?

Look for businesses that have been listed for a while (90+ days), owners who are retiring and don't need all the cash immediately, and situations where the seller wants to ensure a smooth transition. Listing platforms include BizBuySell, Loopnet, and local business brokers. But the best deals are often off-market -- found through relationships, networking, and asking around in your target industry. The longer a business has been for sale, the more likely the seller is open to creative terms.

### What's the difference between seller financing and an SBA loan?

An SBA loan comes from a bank, backed by the Small Business Administration. It typically requires 10-20% down, a solid credit score, and a detailed business plan. The SBA sets the terms. Seller financing comes directly from the person selling the business. They set the terms. The advantage of seller financing is flexibility -- negotiable down payment, interest rate, timeline, and structure. The advantage of SBA is lower interest rates and longer repayment periods. The best deals often combine both: SBA for the bulk, seller carryback for the gap.
