## Before We Start: A Quick Story

When I was 21 years old, I bought my first house at 1805 21st Avenue East in Alabama. I was a newlywed, waiting tables at a Thai restaurant, making $2.13 an hour plus tips.

I had no business buying a house. It was 2008 — the worst financial crisis most of us had ever seen. But sometimes ignorance is a superpower. We didn't know we weren't supposed to be able to buy a house as broke college students. So we just kept talking to bankers until we found one that said yes.

3.5% down. Government grants. No PMI — because I read that I didn't have to pay it, and when the bank said "it's not going to work," guess what? Magically, there were other options.

9 months later, Obama's first-time homebuyer tax credit put an $8,000 check in our mailbox. We used it as the down payment on a rental property 5 minutes away.

Still broke college students. Still making $2.13 an hour. But we owned two homes.

That was 17 years ago. Since then I've bought and sold five 7-8 figure companies, acquired RV and mobile home parks, scaled a business from $63K to $4.3M monthly revenue in 3 months, and bought an $800,000 business for $50,000 down.

Every single one of those deals started with the same problem you have right now: not enough money.

**Good. Because constraints equal creativity.**

This cheat sheet gives you the 10 deal structures I've used (or directly participated in) to buy big things with little money. Each one includes real numbers from real deals, the exact language to use in the conversation, and a worst-case/best-case risk bracket so you know what you're signing up for.

But first — one framework that matters more than all 10 structures combined.

## The Framework Behind Everything: The Mom vs. Stranger Spectrum

If you needed $1,000 right now, you'd ask your mom. Not a stranger on the sidewalk.

Why? Because your mom knows you. She trusts you. She's seen your track record. There's a relationship there.

Every seller starts as a stranger. **Your entire job before you ever pitch a deal structure is to move them closer to "mom" on the trust spectrum.**

How you do that:

- **Visit in person.** Don't email an offer. Drive to the property. Shake hands. Bring your family if it makes sense.
- **Share your story.** Not a pitch — your actual story. Why you want this asset. What you plan to do with it. Who you are.
- **Acknowledge their expertise.** They built this thing. They know it better than you. Ask questions. Listen. Mean it.
- **Follow up.** Most people send one message and disappear. Be the one who calls back.
- **Offer value first.** Share information, connections, ideas — before asking for anything.

Even moving from a 1% chance of "yes" to a 10-20% chance changes everything. That gap is the difference between "no creative deal structure will work" and "let me show you 10 that might."

The structures below are the tools. The relationship is the toolbox.

## How to Use This Cheat Sheet

For each structure, you get:

1. **What it is** — plain English, no jargon walls
2. **Real example** — actual dollar amounts from actual deals
3. **When to use it** — the situation where this structure makes the most sense
4. **What to say** — the conversation starter that opens the door
5. **Risk bracket** — worst case and best case, so you can do the math before you commit
6. **Best paired with** — which other structures can be combined with this one

Print this out. Keep it next to you when you're evaluating deals. Check off the ones that fit your situation. Circle the ones you're going to pitch.

---

## Structure 1: Balloon Payment

**What it is:** Little or nothing down. Small monthly payments for a set period. One large "balloon" payment at the end — which you refinance, pay from profits, or handle by selling the asset before it comes due.

**Real example:** Landscaping business. Purchase price: $200,000. Buyer puts very little down, pays $5,000/month from the business's own cash flow. Sells the business 2 years later for $600,000. The balloon payment never comes due because the asset was sold before it hit.

**When to use it:** You're buying a cash-flowing business or property and you're confident you can either refinance or grow/sell the asset within the balloon period. The monthly payments are manageable from the asset's own income.

**What to say:** *"What if we structured this so I make monthly payments of $X from the business's cash flow, with the remaining balance due in [2-5 years]? That gives me time to grow the business and gives you consistent monthly income starting day one."*

**Risk bracket:**
- **Worst case:** Asset underperforms, balloon comes due, you can't refinance or sell. You may lose the asset and any payments you've made.
- **Best case:** Asset cash-flows easily, you sell or refinance before the balloon, and you've bought a $200K business that you flipped for $600K without tying up your own capital.

**Best paired with:** Graduated Payments (Structure 3) — start payments small, increase over time, balloon at the end.

**Fit check:** [ ] The asset cash-flows enough to cover monthly payments from day one. [ ] I have a realistic exit or refinance plan before the balloon hits.

---

## Structure 2: Interest-Only Payments

**What it is:** You pay only the interest on the note for a set period. No principal reduction. The full balance is still owed at the end.

**Real example:** $500,000 property at 6% interest = $2,500/month in interest-only payments. Compare that to a fully amortizing payment of roughly $3,300/month. You save $800/month in the early years when cash flow is tightest.

**When to use it:** Cash flow is tight in the early months, but you expect the asset to stabilize or appreciate. You need breathing room before you start chipping away at principal.

**What to say:** *"I'd like to propose interest-only payments for the first [12-24 months] while I stabilize operations. After that, we transition to full principal and interest. This way you're earning a return from day one, and I get the runway I need to maximize the asset's potential — which benefits both of us at the back end."*

**Risk bracket:**
- **Worst case:** The asset doesn't appreciate or stabilize. You've been paying interest without reducing principal. You owe the same amount you started with and the note comes due.
- **Best case:** You use the cash flow savings to reinvest in the asset, grow its value, and refinance at better terms or sell at a premium.

**Best paired with:** Balloon Payment (Structure 1) — interest-only for 2 years, then a balloon. Gives you maximum cash flow flexibility upfront.

**Fit check:** [ ] I have a specific plan for what I'll do with the cash flow savings. [ ] The asset is likely to appreciate or stabilize within the interest-only period.

---

## Structure 3: Graduated Payments

**What it is:** Payments start very small and increase on a set schedule over time. Instead of $0/month for 6 months followed by full payments, you start at something — even if it's tiny — and ramp up as the asset performs.

**Real example:** Start at $500/month. After 6 months, bump to $700. Then $1,000. Then $1,500. Then $2,000. Seller sees money from month one. You get time to grow into the full payment.

**When to use it:** The seller is nervous about "zero payments" for any period. Starting small — even $500/month — is better than nothing because it proves you're legitimate and builds trust immediately. This is a relationship play as much as a financial one.

**What to say:** *"I'd rather start paying you something from day one than ask for a grace period. What if we start at $500/month and scale up to the full payment over [12-18 months]? You'll see I'm serious from the first check, and I'll have time to grow into the full number."*

**Risk bracket:**
- **Worst case:** Asset underperforms and you can't sustain the increasing payments. But you've built goodwill with the seller by paying from day one, which gives you more room to renegotiate than if you'd paid nothing.
- **Best case:** Revenue growth outpaces the payment increases. By the time you're at full payment, the asset is generating more than enough to cover it.

**Best paired with:** Balloon Payment (Structure 1) — graduated payments leading to a balloon creates a smooth cash flow curve with a defined endpoint.

**Fit check:** [ ] I can afford a small payment from day one. [ ] I expect revenue growth over the next 12-18 months.

---

## Structure 4: Partial Seller Carryback

**What it is:** The seller finances part of the purchase price (usually as a second lien), a bank finances the majority, and you put down a smaller amount. The seller "carries back" a portion so you don't have to come up with a massive down payment.

**Real example:** My best friend bought a $2.2 million business. SBA loan covered about 80%. The seller held 10% as a note. My friend put down 10% — roughly $200K — from a mix of savings, my investment, and other friends and family money. Without the seller carrying that 10%, the deal doesn't happen. The bank wouldn't have moved forward without it, and my friend didn't have $440K sitting around.

**When to use it:** The bank wants more down payment than you have. The seller is motivated and willing to stay in the deal temporarily. This is one of the most common structures in small business acquisitions and commercial real estate.

**What to say:** *"The bank is willing to do [X%] of the purchase price. If you'd be open to carrying [10-20%] as a second lien note — at a fair interest rate, fully secured by the asset — I can make this work. It closes the gap between what the bank will do and what I can bring to the table."*

**Risk bracket:**
- **Worst case:** Business underperforms, you default on both the bank note and the seller note. The bank gets paid first (first lien), seller may not recover their carryback. This is why the seller's trust matters — they're taking real risk on you.
- **Best case:** Business performs, you service both notes, and the seller gets paid in full with interest — often better than the lump sum they would have received, because you're paying interest on that carryback.

**Best paired with:** Graduated Payments (Structure 3) on the seller carryback portion — standard bank payments on the first lien, graduated payments on the seller's second lien.

**Fit check:** [ ] I have a bank willing to finance the majority. [ ] The gap between the bank's maximum and the purchase price is small enough for the seller to carry.

---

## Structure 5: Shared Appreciation Mortgage

**What it is:** The seller gives you better terms today in exchange for a percentage of the future upside. Instead of paying a higher price now, you're cutting the seller into the profits later.

**Real example:** The seller says the property could be worth $3 million in a few years. Your response: *"Great. If you believe it's going to be worth $3M, give me better terms today — lower price, lower down payment, lower interest rate — and I'll give you 15% of the appreciation when I sell or refinance. If you're right about the $3M, you make more money than if you'd sold at full price today."*

You're using the seller's own optimism as a negotiating lever.

**When to use it:** The seller believes the asset has significant upside potential but needs to sell now. They're emotionally attached to the "what it could be worth" number. Instead of arguing about today's price, agree on a structure where they benefit from tomorrow's value.

**What to say:** *"You've built something that has real upside ahead of it. I don't want to shortchange that. What if instead of negotiating hard on today's price, I give you [X%] of the appreciation above [current value] when I exit? You get better terms for me now, and a bigger payday for you later."*

**Risk bracket:**
- **Worst case:** The asset doesn't appreciate. The seller got better terms (lower price, deferred payment) and you got an asset that didn't grow. They don't get the upside payout, but they also took less risk than a full-price sale.
- **Best case:** The asset appreciates significantly. The seller gets a piece of the upside they helped create. You got in with lower capital requirements. Both sides win more than a simple sale would have produced.

**Best paired with:** Zero Down (Structure 7) — no money down plus shared appreciation is a strong pitch for a seller who believes in the asset's future.

**Fit check:** [ ] The seller is emotionally attached to the asset's potential. [ ] I genuinely believe the asset has upside (this only works if both sides believe in the future value).

---

## Structure 6: Lease to Own / Master Lease

**What it is:** You lease the asset (property, business, equipment) with an option to purchase at a predetermined price and timeline. You operate it as if you own it, but the seller retains title until you exercise the option.

**Real example:** A $2 million RV park in Louisiana. It was generating $12,000/month in rents but had been listed for sale for 2 years with no buyers because it needed a huge amount of work. I negotiated a lease for $7,000/month with a 2-year option to buy at $3-4 million. At 90% occupancy, that park could be worth $23 million.

Worst case for the seller: they collect $7,000/month for 24 months ($168,000 total), I don't exercise the option, and they get their property back — probably in better shape than they left it. They're no worse off than before.

Best case for the seller: I buy at a 50-100% premium over the original asking price, and they made lease payments in the meantime.

Worst case for me: I spend 2 years operating a park and walk away. I learned a ton and limited my downside to the lease payments.

Best case for me: I stabilize the park, exercise the option at $3-4M, and own an asset worth multiples of that.

**When to use it:** The asset needs work. The seller has been trying to sell it with no luck. You don't have the capital or financing for a purchase, but you can operate it. The seller is tired and would rather collect income than keep trying to sell.

**What to say:** *"I know this has been listed for a while. What if I lease it from you at $X/month — you get guaranteed income starting now — and I have the option to purchase at $X within [2-3 years]? If I don't buy, you get the property back and you've collected $X in the meantime. You're no worse off, and you might be a lot better off."*

**Risk bracket:**
- **Worst case:** You operate the asset for the lease period, it doesn't perform, you walk away. You've lost the lease payments and your time. Seller got paid and gets the asset back.
- **Best case:** You turn the asset around, exercise the option at a price that's now well below market value, and own something worth significantly more than you paid.

**Best paired with:** Graduated Payments (Structure 3) on the lease amount — start lower, increase as you stabilize operations.

**Fit check:** [ ] The asset is underperforming or needs work. [ ] The seller has been struggling to find a buyer. [ ] I'm willing and able to operate the asset for the lease period.

---

## Structure 7: Zero Down / 100% Seller Financing

**What it is:** The seller finances the entire purchase price. You put nothing down. In exchange, you typically pay a higher interest rate, a higher purchase price, or both.

**Real example:** The seller wants 5% interest and 10% down. You counter: 8% interest and 0% down. You're trading a higher cost of capital for zero upfront cash. Run the numbers in a spreadsheet or ChatGPT — model different interest rates against different down payments until you find the combination where the monthly payment works and the total cost of the deal still makes sense.

**When to use it:** The seller doesn't need a lump sum right now. They want income (monthly payments). You have zero or very little capital but strong cash flow projections on the asset. The key: the seller has to trust you, which goes back to the Mom vs. Stranger Spectrum.

**What to say:** *"I can offer you a higher interest rate — [X%] instead of [Y%] — in exchange for zero down. That means you earn more on the note over time than you would with a down payment at a lower rate. I can also offer [collateral/personal guarantee/higher price] to reduce your risk."*

**Risk bracket:**
- **Worst case:** You default. The seller takes the asset back (they're in first lien position). They've collected some payments and they still own the asset. Your credit takes a hit and you lose your time/effort.
- **Best case:** You operate the asset profitably, service the debt, and own something you bought with zero capital out of pocket. The higher interest rate is the cost of entry — and if the asset performs, it's a cost you can afford.

**Best paired with:** Graduated Payments (Structure 3) and/or Interest-Only (Structure 2) for the first period — zero down with a ramp-up in payments.

**Fit check:** [ ] The seller prioritizes income over a lump sum. [ ] I can service the higher interest rate from the asset's cash flow. [ ] I've built enough trust with the seller for them to take this risk.

---

## Structure 8: Asset Swap / Services in Lieu

**What it is:** Instead of cash for the down payment, you offer something else of value — a vehicle, real estate you already own, equipment, consulting services, marketing services, agency work. The "down payment" isn't money. It's value in another form.

**Real example:** You own a marketing agency. The seller needs help with their other business's marketing. You offer 12 months of marketing services (valued at $30,000-50,000) as the down payment on their property. The seller gets something they need. You get an asset without writing a check.

Another version: you own a paid-off truck worth $40,000. Use it as collateral or trade it directly as part of the down payment.

**When to use it:** You have skills, assets, or services that the seller actually needs. The seller has a pain point you can solve that isn't "I need cash." This requires listening during the relationship-building phase — what does the seller actually want?

**What to say:** *"I noticed you mentioned [their pain point/need]. What if part of the deal included me [providing X service / offering Y asset] as a portion of the down payment? That way you're getting something you need, and I'm putting real value — just not cash — into the deal."*

**Risk bracket:**
- **Worst case:** The seller doesn't value what you're offering, and this doesn't work. No downside — you just move to a different structure.
- **Best case:** You trade something you already have (or something that costs you time, not cash) for equity in an asset. Highest-leverage play in the entire cheat sheet.

**Best paired with:** Partial Seller Carryback (Structure 4) — services as part of the down payment, seller carries the rest.

**Fit check:** [ ] I have a skill, service, or asset the seller actually wants. [ ] The seller's needs go beyond "I just need cash."

---

## Structure 9: Subject to Existing Debt (Sub-2)

**What it is:** You take over the seller's existing loan payments. The debt stays in the seller's name. You get control of the asset and make the payments.

**When to use it:** The seller's existing debt is low relative to the asset's value. The seller is tired — they don't want to deal with the property or business anymore, they just want out. They may be behind on payments. The existing loan terms might be better than anything you could get on your own (lower interest rate from a different era, for example).

**What to say:** *"What if I took over your existing payments? The loan stays in your name, but I handle every payment going forward. You're free of the obligation, and I take over from here. I can also put [X amount / collateral] as additional security so you know the payments will be made."*

**Risk bracket:**
- **Worst case:** Most loans have a "due on sale" clause — meaning the lender can technically call the loan due if ownership changes. In practice, lenders rarely enforce this as long as payments are current. But it's a real risk. If you miss payments, the seller's credit gets destroyed — not yours. This structure requires high trust.
- **Best case:** You acquire an asset with no new financing, at an existing interest rate that might be better than market, with minimal upfront capital. The seller walks away clean.

**Best paired with:** Lease to Own (Structure 6) as a fallback — if sub-2 feels too risky for the seller, a master lease achieves a similar result with less legal exposure.

**Fit check:** [ ] The seller's existing debt is manageable. [ ] The seller is motivated to exit, not just "testing the market." [ ] I understand and accept the due-on-sale clause risk.

---

## Structure 10: Delayed Down Payment

**What it is:** You close the deal now. You pay the down payment 12-24 months from now. The seller has first lien position on the asset, so if the down payment never shows up, they take the asset back.

**When to use it:** You're confident the asset will generate enough cash flow to fund the down payment within 1-2 years. The seller gets a higher price or better terms in exchange for waiting. The seller's risk is minimal — they have the asset as collateral.

**What to say:** *"I'd like to close now and defer the down payment for [12-24 months]. During that time, I'll make full monthly payments. You'll hold first lien position, so if the down payment doesn't materialize, you take the property back — and you've collected [X months] of payments in the meantime. You're protected either way."*

**Risk bracket:**
- **Worst case:** Asset underperforms, you can't make the deferred down payment. Seller takes the asset back. You've lost your time and any payments you made. Seller collected income and still owns the asset.
- **Best case:** Asset performs, you pay the deferred down payment from the asset's own profits, and you've effectively bought something with no money out of pocket at closing.

**Best paired with:** Graduated Payments (Structure 3) — start with lower monthly payments while building toward the deferred down payment.

**Fit check:** [ ] The asset cash-flows enough to fund the down payment within the deferral period. [ ] The seller is comfortable with first lien protection instead of upfront cash.

## The Negotiation Principle That Ties It All Together

**My price, your terms. Your price, my terms.**

If the seller won't budge on price — negotiate the terms. The down payment, the interest rate, the payment schedule, the timeline, the structure.

If the seller won't budge on terms — negotiate the price.

The question to keep asking: *"Can I remove some risk instead of adding cash? Can I change the timeline instead of the price? Can I change the terms instead of the price?"*

And the rule underneath all of it:

**It should only be math to you.** Don't get emotionally invested. Be willing to walk from any deal at any time. Fall in love with an asset class, not a specific asset. The second you start thinking "this is THE deal" — the only deal, the best deal — you've already lost the negotiation.

Everything is figureoutable. The only question is how much are you willing to negotiate.

## Your Next Move Checklist

You've got the 10 structures. You've got the decision matrix. Here's what to do with them:

- [ ] **Pick your asset class.** Real estate, small business, franchise, equipment. Fall in love with the class, not a specific asset. Be flexible on geography, size, and price point.
- [ ] **Find 3-5 potential deals.** Don't fixate on one. Having options gives you negotiating power and emotional detachment.
- [ ] **Start building the relationship.** Visit in person. Share your story. Ask questions. Listen. Follow up. Move them from "stranger" toward "mom" on the trust spectrum.
- [ ] **Identify the seller's real needs** using Question 1 from the decision matrix. What do they actually want? Income? Freedom? Maximum return? Help?
- [ ] **Match 2-3 structures** to the seller's needs AND your situation. Don't pitch all 10. Pitch the ones that solve THEIR problem.
- [ ] **Run the numbers.** Model different structures in a spreadsheet or ChatGPT. What does each scenario look like at 12 months, 24 months, 5 years? It should only be math.
- [ ] **Make the offer.** Use the conversation starters from each structure. Lead with what's in it for the seller. Show them the worst-case/best-case bracket.
- [ ] **Be willing to walk.** If the math doesn't work, the math doesn't work. There are more deals. There are always more deals.

## One More Thing

I started with $2.13 an hour and two people who didn't know what they were doing. 17 years later, I've bought and sold five companies, I own RV parks, I run a real estate PE fund acquiring 1-3 parks a month, and I still default to creative deal structuring — not because I don't have money now, but because constraints make you better.

The structures in this cheat sheet aren't theoretical. Every single one has real dollars behind it. Real closings. Real handshakes. The only thing between you and your first (or next) creative deal is the willingness to ask.

So ask.
