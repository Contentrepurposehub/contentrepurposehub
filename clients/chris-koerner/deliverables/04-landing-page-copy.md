## WHAT YOU'LL GET SECTION

### Inside the Cheat Sheet:

**10 seller financing structures with real dollar amounts from real deals.** Balloon payments, graduated payments, master leases, partial carrybacks, shared appreciation mortgages, zero-down structures, asset swaps, sub-2, delayed down payments, and interest-only arrangements. Each one broken down: how it works, when to use it, what to say to the seller, and the risk you're actually taking.

**The "My Price, Your Terms" negotiation framework.** The two-sentence reframe that turns a dead deal into a structured deal. If the seller won't move on price, you move on terms. If they won't move on terms, you move on price. One of these always works.

**The Mom vs. Stranger trust spectrum.** Why your relationship with the seller matters more than your bank balance -- and the specific steps to move from "stranger" to "someone they'd do a handshake deal with." This is the part nobody teaches because it can't be turned into a formula. I turned it into a framework anyway.

**The worst-case/best-case bracket for every structure.** So you know exactly what you're risking before you open your mouth. I don't do deals where the worst case ruins me. Neither should you.

## SOCIAL PROOF SECTION

### Who Made This?

I'm Chris Koerner. Here's the short version:

- **17 years** buying real estate. **7 years** buying RV and mobile home parks.
- Started and sold **five 7-8 figure companies** across five industries.
- Bought an **$800,000 business for $50,000 down.**
- Bought my first house as a broke college kid making **$2.13/hour** at a Thai restaurant in Alabama. During the 2008 financial crisis. Used government grants for the 3.5% down payment. Nine months later, used an $8,000 tax credit to buy a second property. Still making $2.13/hour.
- Negotiated a **master lease on a $2M RV park for $7,000/month** -- with an option to buy at $3-4M.
- Scaled a 2021 acquisition from **$63K to $4.3M monthly revenue** in 3 months.

I grew up poor. I'm cheap. I don't like paying full price for anything. That's not an apology -- that's why I got good at this.

Everything in this cheat sheet comes from deals I've done or directly helped structure. No textbook theory. No "have you heard of Kickstarter?" If it's in the guide, there's a real deal behind it with real numbers.

## HOW IT WORKS SECTION

### Three Steps. That's It.

**1. Enter your email below.**

**2. Get the Deal Structure Cheat Sheet in your inbox.**
All 10 structures. The negotiation frameworks. The risk brackets. Print it, save it, bring it to your next seller conversation.

**3. Start structuring deals instead of waiting for capital.**
Every month you spend "saving up" is a month of deal flow you miss and relationships you don't build. The structures in this guide are how people buy $800K businesses for $50K down. Not because they found a loophole -- because they asked better questions.

## FAQ SECTION

**"Is this actually free?"**
Yes. No credit card. No upsell page. You give me your email, I send you the cheat sheet. I also write a free weekly newsletter at tkopod.com where I break down deals like this with real numbers. You'll get that too. Unsubscribe whenever you want.

**"I've never done a deal before. Is this too advanced?"**
No. I wrote this the same way I explain deal structures on my YouTube channel -- plain language, real examples, no jargon without an explanation. If you know what "monthly payment" means, you can use this guide. I bought my first house knowing almost nothing. Sometimes ignorance is a superpower.

**"What if I want more than a cheat sheet?"**
I run a community called TKOwners -- 750+ members at $99/month. It's where operators share the deals they're actually doing, with actual numbers. But start with the free cheat sheet. See if the way I think about deal-making makes sense to you first.

## FOOTER CTA SECTION

### Stop Saving Up. Start Structuring Deals.

You don't need more money. You need a different conversation with the seller.

These 10 structures are how I went from $2.13/hour to five companies. Not because I got lucky. Because being broke forced me to ask better questions than people with capital.

Constraints equal creativity. This cheat sheet is the proof.
