# Newsletter Edition: The $2.13/Hour Playbook

**Subject Line:** I bought my first house making $2.13/hour. Here's what I did differently.

**Preview Text:** Constraints aren't your problem. They're the playbook.

I was 21, just married, and waiting tables at a Thai restaurant in Alabama for $2.13 an hour plus tips.

My wife and I had just moved. We had almost nothing. And it was 2008 -- the worst financial crisis most of us will ever see.

So naturally, we decided to buy a house.

I know. Not exactly what the financial advisors recommend when you're a broke college student during a market collapse. But here's the thing -- we'd spent the summer reading every book about real estate we could find, and I had this annoying belief that if other people had figured it out, we could too.

We found a place on Zillow. 1805 21st Avenue East. $90,000.

The math was simple. Government grants plus what we'd saved from tips got us to 3.5% down. We walked into the bank and asked for a loan.

The banker wanted us to pay PMI -- private mortgage insurance. That's an extra $160/month on top of the mortgage. My payment was going to go from $535 to almost $700 because the bank wanted insurance in case I defaulted.

I said no.

The banker told me that wasn't going to work. I told her I'd read the fine print and I knew there were other loan products that didn't require PMI. She could either give me one of those loans or I'd find another bank.

Guess what? Magically, there were other options.

We closed on that house. I owned it for 11 years. Rented it out for 9 of those.

**Here's the part nobody focuses on.**

9 months after we closed, an $8,000 check showed up in the mail. Obama's first-time homebuyer tax credit. We weren't expecting it. We didn't even know the exact amount until it arrived.

We used every dollar of it as the down payment on a second home. A rental. Five minutes from the first one.

Still broke college students. Still making $2.13 an hour. But we owned two homes.

I've told that story a hundred times. And every time, the response I hear most is: "That's cool, but I don't have any money to start."

And you know what I say to that?

Good.

Because having no money isn't the problem. I'm going to make an argument that it's actually your biggest advantage -- and I know that sounds like something a motivational speaker says before they pitch you a $2,000 course. But stay with me, because this is just math.

Bootstrapped startups have statistically the same success rate as venture-funded ones. That's not my opinion. It's data. And it makes sense when you think about it.

When you have money, you throw cash at problems. You hire before you need to. You rent the expensive office. You buy the premium software suite. You skip the hard conversations because you can afford to avoid them.

When you have no money, you can't do any of that. So you're forced to ask better questions.

Questions like:

- What does the seller actually want? (It's not always the highest price.)
- What's flexible in this deal? (Almost everything, if you ask.)
- Can I remove risk instead of adding cash?
- Can I change the timeline instead of the price?
- Can I change the terms instead of the price?

Those questions are worth more than a fat bank account. Because they lead to deal structures that most people with money never even think about.

**Let me give you a quick example.**

A friend of mine bought a $2.2 million business. SBA covered about 80%. The seller held 10% as a note. And the remaining 10% -- about $200K -- came from savings, a small investment from me, and a few friends and family.

He layered four different funding sources to get to 100%.

Nobody handed him $2.2 million. Nobody handed him $200K. He built the structure one conversation at a time, and every conversation started with the same question: "What are you flexible on?"

That's what constraints do. They force you to have conversations you'd otherwise skip. And those conversations are where every creative deal lives.

**The framework I keep coming back to is what I call the Mom vs. Stranger Spectrum.**

If you needed $1,000 right now, who would you call -- your mom or a random stranger? Obviously your mom. Because there's trust. History. Relationship.

When you're trying to buy something big with little money, every seller starts as a stranger. Your entire job is to move them closer to the "mom" end of the spectrum.

That means showing up in person. Bringing your family. Sharing your story. Asking about their story. Following up when you say you will. Being honest about what you can and can't afford.

You're not trying to trick anyone. You're trying to build enough trust that the seller says, "I believe this person is going to take care of my thing, and I'm comfortable structuring terms that work for both of us."

Even moving from a 1% chance of "yes" to a 10% chance changes everything. Because now you're in a conversation. And conversations lead to structures. And structures are how broke people buy big things.

I didn't have money when I bought that first house. I had a story, a willingness to ask uncomfortable questions, and the ignorance to not know I wasn't supposed to be able to do it.

Sometimes ignorance is a superpower.

17 years later, I've bought and sold five 7-8 figure companies across five industries. I own an RV park in Waco. I'm a GP in a real estate PE fund that acquires 1-3 parks every month. I run CoFounders.com, where we fund undergrads with salary and training. I run TexasSnax.com, a 7-figure Buc-ee's resale business.

All of it started with a $90,000 house, a $2.13/hour paycheck, and the refusal to accept that "not enough money" was a real excuse.

It's not.

It never was.

The money is a problem you solve with structure, relationships, and creativity -- not a barrier that stops you from playing.

Stop waiting until you "have enough." The waiting is the mistake.

**I recorded a full breakdown of 10 specific deal structures I've used to buy businesses and real estate with little or no money down.** Balloon payments, graduated payments, master leases, partial seller carrybacks, shared appreciation mortgages, asset swaps -- each one with real numbers from real deals.

It's the most tactical thing I've ever put out on this topic.

And if you're past the point of watching from the sidelines -- if you want to be in a room with 750+ operators who share their actual deal structures, actual numbers, and actual wins and losses every week -- that's what TKOwners is.
