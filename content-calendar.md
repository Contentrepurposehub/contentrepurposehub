# 90-Day Blog Content Calendar
## ContentRepurposeHub.com | Webinar Repurposing Service

**Created:** February 9, 2026
**Timeline:** Weeks 1-12 (publish 1 post per week)
**Goal:** Own the "webinar repurposing" keyword category, drive organic traffic from coaches/consultants/course creators, and build topical authority that surfaces in both Google and AI search results.

---

## Executive Summary

**The Opportunity:** "Webinar repurposing" as a keyword category has near-zero direct competition. Competitors (Content10x, Repurpose.io, Chopcast) focus on broad "content repurposing" or podcast/video repurposing. Nobody has built a dedicated SEO moat around the webinar-specific angle. This 12-post calendar is designed to claim that territory before anyone else does.

**The Strategy:** Build a pillar-and-cluster content architecture. Post #1 is the comprehensive pillar guide targeting the head term "webinar repurposing." Posts #2-12 are cluster articles targeting long-tail variations and adjacent intent keywords, all internally linking back to the pillar. This structure signals topical authority to search engines and creates a content web that captures traffic across the full buyer journey (awareness to decision).

**Key Research Findings:**
- 52% of marketers use webinars in their content strategy, but only ~20% of that content gets repurposed (massive gap)
- HubSpot data shows 60% of marketers get more leads from repurposed content than original content
- Repurposed content generates 3x more engagement than single-use content while reducing creation time by up to 60%
- The "content repurposing for coaches" and "webinar to blog post" keyword clusters have low competition and clear commercial intent
- AI-assisted repurposing is a 2026 trend (43% of marketers use AI for content creation) but "done-for-you" services still outperform DIY for busy coaches
- Content repurposing is the 5th most popular digital marketing trend of 2026 per HubSpot's State of Marketing report

**Content Architecture:**
- 1 Pillar Guide (3,000+ words) -- the hub
- 4 How-To / Tutorial posts -- process-oriented, high search intent
- 3 Listicle / Framework posts -- shareable, link-worthy
- 2 Comparison / Decision posts -- commercial intent, bottom-of-funnel
- 1 Data-Driven post -- link bait, authority builder
- 1 Case Study post -- social proof, conversion driver

## Detailed Post Breakdowns

---

### POST #1 (Week 1) -- PILLAR GUIDE
**Priority:** 1 (Publish First)

**Target Keyword Cluster:**
- Primary: "webinar repurposing"
- Secondary: "repurpose webinar content," "webinar content repurposing," "how to repurpose a webinar"
- Long-tail: "webinar repurposing guide," "webinar repurposing strategy"

**Blog Post Title:**
"Webinar Repurposing: The Complete Guide to Turning 1 Webinar Into 50+ Content Pieces"

**Search Intent:** Informational / Commercial hybrid

**Content Type:** Pillar Guide

**Estimated Word Count:** 3,000-3,500

**Why This Topic Matters:**
This is the foundational asset for the entire SEO strategy. The term "webinar repurposing" has near-zero dedicated content competing for it. Most search results return generic "content repurposing" guides that mention webinars as one bullet point. Nobody has written the definitive, comprehensive guide focused exclusively on webinar repurposing. Whoever publishes this first and does it well will own the featured snippet and AI search citations for this entire category. This post becomes the hub that all cluster posts link back to, compounding authority over time.

**Outline:**
1. What is webinar repurposing (and why 80% of webinar content goes to waste)
2. The webinar repurposing framework: input, process, output
3. Complete list of content types you can extract from a single webinar (blog posts, LinkedIn posts, email sequences, lead magnets, newsletters, short-form video clips, quote graphics, Twitter/X threads, podcast episodes, carousel posts, infographics, FAQ pages, course modules, case study snippets)
4. Step-by-step webinar repurposing workflow
5. Tools vs. done-for-you services (when to use each)
6. How webinar repurposing fits into your broader content strategy
7. Common mistakes and how to avoid them
8. Getting started: your first repurposing sprint

**Internal Linking Strategy:** This post will be linked TO from every subsequent cluster post. Include jump links to sections that align with cluster post topics.

### POST #2 (Week 2) -- HOW-TO
**Priority:** 2

**Target Keyword Cluster:**
- Primary: "repurpose webinar into blog posts," "webinar to blog post"
- Secondary: "turn webinar into blog post," "convert webinar to article"
- Long-tail: "how to turn a webinar recording into a blog post," "webinar transcript to blog post"

**Blog Post Title:**
"How to Turn a Webinar Into a Blog Post (Step-by-Step Process With Examples)"

**Search Intent:** Informational

**Content Type:** How-To Tutorial

**Estimated Word Count:** 2,000-2,500

**Why This Topic Matters:**
"Webinar to blog post" is one of the most searched specific repurposing actions. Multiple high-authority sites (Benchmark Email, WorkCast, ON24) have content on this, but none are written from the perspective of coaches and consultants, and most are thin (under 1,000 words). The opportunity is to write a deeper, more actionable guide that ranks alongside or above these generalist posts by being more specific to the target audience. Blog posts created from webinar content also create SEO assets that drive long-term organic traffic -- unlike the webinar itself, which requires registration and has a limited shelf life.

**Outline:**
1. Why webinars are the best raw material for blog content
2. The transcript-first method (getting your webinar transcribed)
3. Identifying the strongest blog-worthy sections from a single webinar
4. Restructuring conversational content for written format
5. SEO optimization: keywords, headers, meta descriptions
6. Adding visuals from your slides and presentation
7. Three blog post templates you can use today
8. Example: before and after (raw transcript vs. finished blog post)

**Internal Linking Strategy:** Link back to Pillar Guide (Post #1). Forward-link to Post #7 (social media) and Post #9 (lead magnets).

### POST #3 (Week 3) -- FRAMEWORK
**Priority:** 3

**Target Keyword Cluster:**
- Primary: "webinar content strategy," "content strategy for coaches"
- Secondary: "webinar marketing strategy coaches," "coach content marketing plan"
- Long-tail: "content strategy for coaches who do webinars," "webinar content plan for consultants"

**Blog Post Title:**
"The Webinar-First Content Strategy: How Coaches and Consultants Can Create 3 Months of Content From 1 Monthly Webinar"

**Search Intent:** Informational

**Content Type:** How-To / Strategic Framework

**Estimated Word Count:** 2,000-2,500

**Why This Topic Matters:**
This post directly addresses the core pain point discovered in market research: coaches and consultants are overwhelmed by content creation and it feels like a second full-time job. By positioning the webinar as the single content input that fuels everything else, this post reframes the problem and presents ContentRepurposeHub's exact value proposition as the natural solution. The keyword "content strategy for coaches" has meaningful search volume and is dominated by generic advice posts -- none of which position the webinar as the central content engine. This is a differentiation play.

**Outline:**
1. The content creation trap: why coaches burn out on marketing
2. The webinar-first model: one input, dozens of outputs
3. Monthly content calendar powered by a single webinar
4. Mapping content types to funnel stages (awareness, consideration, decision)
5. The minimum viable webinar for maximum content output
6. How to plan webinar topics that feed your content strategy for 90 days
7. Real math: time invested vs. content produced (DIY vs. done-for-you)

**Internal Linking Strategy:** Link to Pillar Guide (Post #1) and forward-link to Post #4 (content pieces from one webinar) and Post #11 (workflow).

### POST #4 (Week 4) -- LISTICLE
**Priority:** 4

**Target Keyword Cluster:**
- Primary: "how many content pieces from one webinar," "content pieces from webinar"
- Secondary: "repurpose one webinar into content," "webinar content multiplier"
- Long-tail: "how to get 50 content pieces from one webinar," "maximize webinar content output"

**Blog Post Title:**
"From 1 Webinar to 75+ Content Pieces: The Complete Breakdown of What You Can Create"

**Search Intent:** Informational

**Content Type:** Listicle / Breakdown

**Estimated Word Count:** 1,800-2,200

**Why This Topic Matters:**
This is the "show, don't tell" post. Most competitors claim you can get "10+" pieces from a webinar. ContentRepurposeHub claims 14-75+. This post substantiates that claim by listing and categorizing every single content piece, making the service's value proposition tangible and shareable. It directly supports the homepage messaging and gives potential customers a concrete understanding of what they receive. This post also has strong "snippet" potential for searches like "how many pieces of content from a webinar" because Google and AI search love enumerated, structured answers.

**Outline:**
1. Why most people underestimate a webinar's content potential
2. The complete breakdown (organized by category):
   - Written content (blog posts, articles, LinkedIn posts, Twitter/X threads, email sequences, newsletters, captions)
   - Visual content (quote graphics, carousel posts, infographics, slide decks, thumbnail images)
   - Audio/Video content (short clips, podcast episodes, audiograms, YouTube Shorts, Reels)
   - Lead generation content (ebooks, checklists, worksheets, PDF guides, webinar replay pages)
   - SEO content (FAQ pages, pillar articles, glossary entries)
3. The math: 1 webinar = 75 pieces at different tiers
4. Which pieces drive which business outcomes (traffic, leads, authority, sales)
5. Why you probably cannot do this yourself (and what to prioritize if you try)

**Internal Linking Strategy:** Link to Pillar Guide (Post #1), Post #2 (blog posts), Post #7 (social media), Post #9 (lead magnets).

### POST #5 (Week 5) -- HOW-TO
**Priority:** 5

**Target Keyword Cluster:**
- Primary: "webinar follow up email sequence," "webinar email sequence"
- Secondary: "post webinar email strategy," "webinar nurture sequence"
- Long-tail: "how to write webinar follow up emails," "webinar email sequence templates for coaches"

**Blog Post Title:**
"Webinar Follow-Up Email Sequences That Convert: Templates and Strategy for Coaches"

**Search Intent:** Informational

**Content Type:** How-To with Templates

**Estimated Word Count:** 2,000-2,500

**Why This Topic Matters:**
"Webinar follow up email" and "webinar email sequence" are well-searched terms with clear intent. The current top results (Livestorm, Contrast, Demio, ActiveCampaign) are written by webinar platform companies -- not from the perspective of coaches and consultants. This creates an opening for a more audience-specific, practitioner-oriented post. Critically, the email sequence is one of the most valuable outputs of webinar repurposing (it directly drives revenue), so this post connects the repurposing service to a measurable business outcome. Including templates makes this post a download-worthy resource that can also serve as a lead magnet.

**Outline:**
1. Why most coaches waste their webinar's biggest conversion opportunity
2. The post-webinar email sequence framework (6-email structure)
3. Email 1: The same-day thank-you and replay link
4. Email 2: Key takeaways and quick wins (24-48 hours)
5. Email 3: The deeper dive (link to blog post from webinar content)
6. Email 4: Social proof and case study
7. Email 5: FAQ and objection handling
8. Email 6: Final call to action with urgency
9. Segmentation: different sequences for attendees vs. no-shows
10. Copy-and-paste templates for each email
11. How this fits into a full webinar repurposing system

**Internal Linking Strategy:** Link to Pillar Guide (Post #1), Post #3 (content strategy), and Post #9 (lead magnets).

### POST #6 (Week 6) -- DATA-DRIVEN
**Priority:** 6

**Target Keyword Cluster:**
- Primary: "content repurposing ROI," "webinar repurposing ROI"
- Secondary: "content repurposing statistics," "is content repurposing worth it"
- Long-tail: "ROI of repurposing webinar content," "content repurposing cost benefit analysis coaches"

**Blog Post Title:**
"The ROI of Webinar Repurposing: Data, Math, and What It Actually Saves You"

**Search Intent:** Informational / Commercial

**Content Type:** Data-Driven / Research-Backed

**Estimated Word Count:** 2,000-2,500

**Why This Topic Matters:**
This is the "justify the investment" post -- essential for prospects who are comparing the cost of the service ($750-$1,500/month) against doing it themselves or not doing it at all. The data is compelling: repurposed content generates 3x more engagement, reduces creation time by 60%, and HubSpot's research shows 60% of marketers get more leads from repurposed content than original. No existing article combines these statistics specifically around webinar repurposing with a clear cost-benefit framework for coaches. This post also has high link-earning potential because other sites reference and link to data-driven content, accelerating domain authority growth.

**Outline:**
1. The hidden cost of leaving webinar content unused
2. Key statistics on content repurposing effectiveness (cite HubSpot, industry data)
3. Time audit: how many hours coaches spend on content creation per week
4. The real cost of DIY repurposing (time x hourly rate)
5. ROI calculation framework: (content output value - service cost) / service cost
6. Case example: a coach spending 15 hours/week on content vs. using a repurposing service
7. The compounding effect: how repurposed content builds organic traffic over time
8. Cost comparison: hiring a VA, using tools, or using a done-for-you service
9. When repurposing pays for itself (the break-even analysis)

**Internal Linking Strategy:** Link to Pillar Guide (Post #1), Post #8 (service vs. DIY comparison), and Post #12 (case study).

### POST #7 (Week 7) -- HOW-TO
**Priority:** 7

**Target Keyword Cluster:**
- Primary: "webinar to social media content," "repurpose webinar for LinkedIn"
- Secondary: "webinar clips for social media," "turn webinar into LinkedIn posts"
- Long-tail: "how to turn webinar content into LinkedIn posts," "webinar to Instagram Reels"

**Blog Post Title:**
"How to Turn Your Webinar Into 30 Days of Social Media Content (LinkedIn, Instagram, and More)"

**Search Intent:** Informational

**Content Type:** How-To Tutorial

**Estimated Word Count:** 1,800-2,200

**Why This Topic Matters:**
Social media is the most immediately visible output of webinar repurposing, and LinkedIn is the primary platform for coaches and consultants. Current search results for "webinar to LinkedIn posts" are dominated by generic social media guides and tool-specific posts (Zapier, Castmagic). None are written specifically for the coach/consultant audience with platform-specific formatting advice. This post bridges the gap between "I have a webinar recording" and "I have a month of ready-to-publish social content." It is also highly shareable on LinkedIn itself, creating a built-in distribution loop.

**Outline:**
1. Why your webinar is a social media content goldmine
2. The extraction process: identifying quotable moments, key insights, and stories
3. LinkedIn-specific formats (text posts, carousels, articles, video clips)
4. Instagram and Reels: what works and what to repurpose
5. Twitter/X threads from webinar talking points
6. YouTube Shorts and TikTok: pulling the right clips
7. A 30-day social media calendar from a single webinar
8. Tools that help (and when a done-for-you service makes more sense)
9. Platform-specific formatting tips and character limits

### POST #8 (Week 8) -- COMPARISON
**Priority:** 8

**Target Keyword Cluster:**
- Primary: "content repurposing service vs DIY," "done for you content repurposing"
- Secondary: "content repurposing tools vs agency," "hire content repurposing service"
- Long-tail: "should I use a content repurposing service or do it myself," "best content repurposing service for coaches"

**Blog Post Title:**
"Content Repurposing: DIY Tools vs. Done-for-You Services -- Which Is Right for Your Coaching Business?"

**Search Intent:** Commercial

**Content Type:** Comparison / Decision Guide

**Estimated Word Count:** 2,200-2,800

**Why This Topic Matters:**
This is a bottom-of-funnel post targeting prospects who already understand the value of repurposing and are deciding how to execute. ContentFries has a post on this topic but it is generic and not coach-specific. The key insight from research is that "both types come at a price -- in one you pay with time and in the other with money." For coaches billing $200-500/hour for their expertise, the math overwhelmingly favors done-for-you. This post makes that case without being overtly salesy by presenting an honest comparison. It naturally positions ContentRepurposeHub as the ideal solution for coaches who value their time.

**Outline:**
1. The repurposing decision every coach faces
2. The DIY path: tools, time investment, and learning curve
   - Repurpose.io ($29/month), Descript, Castmagic, Canva, ChatGPT
   - Realistic time estimate: 10-20 hours per webinar
   - Best for: new coaches with more time than money
3. The done-for-you path: services, investment, and output quality
   - Pricing landscape: $500-$2,000/month
   - Realistic output: 14-75+ pieces per webinar
   - Best for: established coaches billing $150+/hour
4. Head-to-head comparison table (cost, time, quality, consistency, scalability)
5. The hybrid approach: when it makes sense
6. Decision framework: 5 questions to determine your best path
7. What to look for in a repurposing service (red flags and green flags)

### POST #9 (Week 9) -- LISTICLE / HOW-TO
**Priority:** 9

**Target Keyword Cluster:**
- Primary: "webinar lead magnet," "repurpose webinar into lead magnet"
- Secondary: "create lead magnet from webinar," "webinar to ebook"
- Long-tail: "how to turn a webinar into a lead magnet," "webinar content lead generation"

**Blog Post Title:**
"7 High-Converting Lead Magnets You Can Create From a Single Webinar (Without Starting From Scratch)"

**Search Intent:** Informational

**Content Type:** Listicle / How-To Hybrid

**Estimated Word Count:** 1,800-2,200

**Why This Topic Matters:**
Lead magnets are a critical conversion tool for coaches and consultants, and data from Leadpages shows cheat sheets (34% conversion), checklists (27%), and ebooks (24%) are the top performers. Yet most coaches create lead magnets from scratch, which is time-consuming. This post reveals that the best lead magnets are hiding inside their existing webinar content. The keyword "webinar lead magnet" blends two high-intent topics and is underserved -- current results are dominated by generic lead magnet guides (HubSpot, OptinMonster) that do not specifically address webinar-to-lead-magnet conversion. This post fills that gap and directly demonstrates one of ContentRepurposeHub's deliverables.

**Outline:**
1. Why your webinar already contains your next lead magnet
2. Lead Magnet #1: The webinar cheat sheet (1-page summary of key takeaways)
3. Lead Magnet #2: The step-by-step checklist (action items from the webinar)
4. Lead Magnet #3: The mini ebook (expanded version of one webinar section)
5. Lead Magnet #4: The resource guide (all tools and references mentioned)
6. Lead Magnet #5: The worksheet/template (interactive version of a framework you taught)
7. Lead Magnet #6: The webinar replay with bonus content (gated access)
8. Lead Magnet #7: The email mini-course (webinar broken into 5 daily lessons)
9. Which lead magnet to create first (decision matrix based on niche)
10. How to set up the opt-in funnel in under an hour

### POST #10 (Week 10) -- FRAMEWORK
**Priority:** 10

**Target Keyword Cluster:**
- Primary: "evergreen webinar content," "webinar SEO strategy"
- Secondary: "webinar content for SEO," "evergreen webinar funnel content"
- Long-tail: "how to make webinar content rank on Google," "webinar repurposing for SEO and organic traffic"

**Blog Post Title:**
"How to Turn Your Webinars Into Evergreen SEO Assets That Drive Traffic for Years"

**Search Intent:** Informational

**Content Type:** How-To / Strategic Framework

**Estimated Word Count:** 2,000-2,500

**Why This Topic Matters:**
This post targets a sophisticated audience segment: coaches who understand that a webinar is a one-time event but want their content to work for them long after the live session ends. The keyword "evergreen webinar content" bridges two powerful concepts. Current search results are split between generic evergreen content guides and webinar platform marketing pages -- nobody has connected the two concepts specifically for the coach/consultant audience. The SEO angle is also critical for ContentRepurposeHub's positioning because the service does not just create social content (short shelf life) but also builds long-term organic assets (blog posts, FAQ pages, pillar articles) that compound in value. This post demonstrates that compounding value.

**Outline:**
1. The webinar's lifespan problem (and how to solve it)
2. The difference between disposable and evergreen content outputs
3. Blog posts as SEO assets: keyword targeting from webinar topics
4. FAQ pages: mining Q&A sessions for search-friendly content
5. Pillar pages: building topical authority from webinar series
6. On-page SEO checklist for repurposed webinar content
7. Structured data and schema markup for webinar-derived content
8. The content flywheel: how repurposed content drives traffic that drives leads that fund more webinars
9. Measuring success: tracking organic traffic from repurposed content
10. Case example: one webinar generating traffic 18 months later

### POST #11 (Week 11) -- TEMPLATE / LISTICLE
**Priority:** 11

**Target Keyword Cluster:**
- Primary: "content repurposing workflow," "content repurposing system coaches"
- Secondary: "webinar repurposing workflow," "content repurposing process template"
- Long-tail: "content repurposing workflow template for coaches," "step by step content repurposing system"

**Blog Post Title:**
"The Content Repurposing Workflow for Coaches: A Step-by-Step System (With Templates)"

**Search Intent:** Informational

**Content Type:** Listicle / Template / Process Guide

**Estimated Word Count:** 2,000-2,500

**Why This Topic Matters:**
"Content repurposing workflow" is a growing search term as more creators move from ad-hoc repurposing to systematized approaches. Current top results (Planable, WritersLifeForYou, The Blog Social) provide generic workflows. None are tailored to the webinar-centric, coach-specific context. This post serves two audiences: (1) DIY coaches who want to build their own system (they become future customers when they realize the time investment), and (2) coaches evaluating whether to outsource (they see how complex the workflow is and decide to hire help). Either way, the post builds trust and captures email addresses through a downloadable template. The templates themselves are also a lead magnet opportunity.

**Outline:**
1. Why ad-hoc repurposing fails (and what a system looks like)
2. The 5-stage repurposing workflow:
   - Stage 1: Record and transcribe
   - Stage 2: Extract and categorize (key insights, quotes, stories, data points, Q&A)
   - Stage 3: Transform (match content types to extracted assets)
   - Stage 4: Optimize (platform-specific formatting, SEO, brand voice)
   - Stage 5: Distribute and schedule
3. Time estimates for each stage (DIY reality check)
4. Downloadable workflow template (Notion, Google Sheets, or Trello)
5. Tool stack recommendations for each stage
6. How to batch-process for efficiency
7. When the workflow gets too big for one person (the outsourcing trigger point)

### POST #12 (Week 12) -- CASE STUDY
**Priority:** 12

**Target Keyword Cluster:**
- Primary: "webinar repurposing results," "content repurposing case study"
- Secondary: "webinar repurposing service results," "content repurposing before and after"
- Long-tail: "webinar repurposing case study coach," "content repurposing results for consultants"

**Blog Post Title:**
"Case Study: How One Coach Turned 4 Webinars Into 200+ Content Pieces and Doubled Their Organic Traffic"

**Search Intent:** Commercial / Transactional

**Content Type:** Case Study

**Estimated Word Count:** 1,800-2,200

**Why This Topic Matters:**
By week 12, the blog has built informational authority across the webinar repurposing topic cluster. This case study converts that authority into credibility and sales. Case studies rank for commercial-intent keywords ("webinar repurposing results," "content repurposing service results") and serve as the strongest bottom-of-funnel asset. They also perform well in AI search responses when users ask "does webinar repurposing work" or "is a content repurposing service worth it." If no client case study is available yet at publication time, this can be structured as a "model case study" based on the service's methodology with projected/realistic numbers, clearly labeled as such, and replaced with a real client story once available. The post should include specific metrics: content pieces created, traffic growth, leads generated, and time saved.

**Outline:**
1. The starting point: a coach doing 2-4 webinars/month with no repurposing system
2. The challenge: 15+ hours/week on content creation, inconsistent posting, invisible on Google
3. The solution: implementing webinar repurposing (monthly webinar turned into full content engine)
4. The process: what the first 30 days looked like
5. The results (with specific numbers):
   - Content output: from 4 pieces/month to 50+
   - Organic traffic: growth trajectory over 90 days
   - Email list growth: new subscribers from repurposed lead magnets
   - Time saved: from 15 hours/week to 2 hours/week on content
   - Revenue impact: new clients attributed to content
6. Key lessons and what surprised them
7. Before-and-after content calendar comparison
8. What this means for your coaching business (call to action)
