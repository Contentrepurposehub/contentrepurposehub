# Cold Outreach Kit — ContentRepurposeHub

> First-client acquisition. Free project offer. Ready to copy-paste and personalize.

---

## 1. Cold DM (LinkedIn) — Short Version

Use this for coaches you find on LinkedIn who clearly run webinars. Personalize the first line by referencing their specific webinar or content.

---

**Message:**

> Hey [First Name] — I watched your [webinar/workshop title or topic] and thought your framework on [specific thing they taught] was really sharp.
>
> I'm launching a webinar repurposing service and I'm looking for 2-3 coaches to do a free project for — I'd take one of your webinars and turn it into a lead magnet, LinkedIn posts, a blog post, and a newsletter. All yours to keep, no strings.
>
> I get a portfolio piece. You get free content. Interested?

**Word count:** ~80

---

## 2. Cold DM (LinkedIn) — Slightly Longer Version

Use this for coaches who seem like a stronger fit — they run regular webinars, post actively, or have a clear content gap.

---

**Message:**

> Hey [First Name] — I came across your [webinar/workshop/training] on [specific topic] and I really liked how you broke down [specific framework, concept, or teaching point]. Good stuff.
>
> I just launched a content repurposing service focused on coaches and consultants. The idea is simple: I take one webinar recording and turn it into ~14 pieces of content — a lead magnet PDF, 10 LinkedIn posts, a blog post, a newsletter, and landing page copy. Everything gets optimized for Google and AI search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.).
>
> I'm looking for 2-3 people to do this for free in exchange for feedback and (if you're happy with it) a testimonial. No commitment beyond that.
>
> You already have the webinar recorded. I do all the work. You keep everything.
>
> Worth a conversation?

**Word count:** ~140

## 3. Cold Email — Free Project Offer

Use this for coaches whose email you find on their website, podcast show notes, YouTube description, etc. Subject lines matter — keep them short and curiosity-driven.

---

**Subject line options (pick one):**
- Your [webinar topic] webinar — content idea
- Quick idea for your [topic] content
- Repurposing your [webinar name]

**Email:**

> Hi [First Name],
>
> I watched your [webinar/workshop title] on [topic] — specifically the part about [one specific insight or framework they shared]. Really well done.
>
> I'm reaching out because I just started a webinar repurposing service for coaches and consultants. Here's what I do: I take one recorded webinar and turn it into ~14 content pieces — a lead magnet, 10 LinkedIn posts, a blog post, a newsletter issue, and landing page copy. All optimized for both Google search and AI search engines.
>
> I'm building my portfolio and I'm looking for 2-3 people to do this for completely free. No catch. You send me a webinar recording, I deliver the content within 10 business days, and you keep everything.
>
> In return, all I'd ask is honest feedback — and if you're happy with the work, a short testimonial I can use on my site.
>
> If that sounds interesting, I'd love to set up a quick 15-minute call to walk you through exactly what you'd get. Here's my calendar: [link]
>
> Either way, keep making great webinars.
>
> [Your name]
> ContentRepurposeHub

**Word count:** ~185

## 4. Follow-Up Message (3-5 Days Later)

Send if they haven't replied. Keep it short. Don't re-pitch.

---

**Message:**

> Hey [First Name] — just bumping this up in case it got buried. Totally understand if the timing isn't right.
>
> The offer's simple: I repurpose one of your webinars into ~14 content pieces, completely free. You keep everything.
>
> Happy to answer any questions if you're curious. No pressure either way.

**Word count:** ~50

---

## 5. DM for Facebook / Skool Groups

Use when a coach posts in a community about struggling with content creation, repurposing, or staying consistent. Do NOT pitch cold in groups. Only respond to relevant posts. Must feel like a real human replying, not a marketer.

---

**Message:**

> This is exactly the problem I'm trying to solve. I just started a service where I take a single webinar recording and turn it into blog posts, LinkedIn content, a lead magnet, newsletters — basically a month of content from one recording.
>
> I'm looking for 2-3 people to do this for free while I build my portfolio. If you have a webinar sitting in a folder somewhere, I'd be happy to repurpose it for you. DM me if you're interested.

**Word count:** ~80

## 6. Outreach to Podcast/YouTube Hosts — Guest Content Kit Pitch

Use this for podcasters and YouTubers who regularly interview coaches, consultants, or course creators. The pitch: you'll create content kits for their guests, which makes their show more attractive to better guests and turns every guest into a promoter of the show.

**Why this works for you:** One host relationship gives you access to every guest they interview. Those guests are coaches and consultants — your exact target market. They see the quality of your work firsthand without you ever pitching them directly.

---

**LinkedIn DM to Host:**

> Hey [First Name] — I've been watching your interviews on [show name]. The one with [guest name] about [topic] was great.
>
> Quick idea for you. I've been studying what separates podcasts that guests promote vs. ones they forget about. The difference is almost always a content kit — clips of the guest, transcript, post ideas they can use on their own channels.
>
> Most hosts don't do this, which means guests walk away with nothing to share. The show gets one episode. That's it.
>
> I'm launching a content repurposing service and I'd love to create guest content kits for your show — completely free for a few episodes while I build my portfolio. For each guest, I'd deliver:
>
> - 3-5 short clips featuring them (not you)
> - Full transcript with timestamps
> - 5 LinkedIn post ideas based on their best moments
> - 2-3 quote cards from their strongest lines
>
> Your guests get content they'll actually post. Your show gets promoted by every person you interview. I get portfolio pieces.
>
> Worth a quick chat?

**Word count:** ~160

---

**Email to Host:**

**Subject line options:**
- Your guests should be promoting your show (here's how)
- Content kit idea for [show name]
- Quick idea to get better guests on [show name]

> Hi [First Name],
>
> I watch [show name] — the episode with [guest name] on [topic] was especially good.
>
> I noticed something: your guests aren't posting about their episodes on their own channels. That's normal — most podcast hosts don't give guests anything to share. The guest gets a link, maybe a thumbnail, and that's it.
>
> But hosts who provide a guest content kit — short clips of the guest, a transcript, LinkedIn post ideas, quote cards — get something powerful in return: every guest becomes a promoter of the show.
>
> I'm building a content repurposing service and I'd love to create these kits for your next 2-3 guests, completely free. Each guest would get:
>
> - 3-5 short video clips featuring them
> - Full transcript with timestamps
> - 5 post ideas based on their best insights
> - 2-3 quote cards ready to share
>
> You get better guest retention, more promotion, and a reason for bigger names to say yes to your show. I get portfolio pieces and feedback.
>
> Interested? I can walk you through an example in 15 minutes: [calendar link]
>
> [Your name]
> ContentRepurposeHub

## 7. Outreach to Podcast Guests — Free Content Kit

Use this for coaches and consultants who appeared as guests on podcasts or YouTube interviews. Find their episode on YouTube, watch 10-15 minutes, then reach out. The key advantage: the content already exists publicly — you don't need them to send you anything.

---

**LinkedIn DM:**

> Hey [First Name] — I just watched your interview on [show name] where you talked about [specific insight or framework]. Really sharp stuff, especially the part about [specific detail].
>
> Quick question — did they give you any content from that episode? Clips, transcript, post ideas?
>
> I'm building a content repurposing service for coaches and I'd love to create a content kit from that interview for you — completely free. I'd pull out your best moments and turn them into LinkedIn posts, a blog post, short clips, and quote cards. All featuring you, ready to publish.
>
> The episode is already public so I don't need anything from you. I do the work, you get the content.
>
> Interested?

**Word count:** ~120

---

**Why this angle is powerful:**

1. You don't need the coach to send you anything — the episode is already on YouTube
2. It demonstrates your work before you pitch the paid service
3. Every coach who likes the free kit is a warm lead for the full webinar repurposing service
4. The transition is natural: "If you liked what I did with a 30-minute podcast episode, imagine what I can do with your webinars"

## 8. Where to Find Prospects — Practical Guide

### LinkedIn Search Queries

Copy and paste these into LinkedIn search. Filter by "People" and look at their recent activity.

**Search terms — coaches with webinars:**
- `coach webinar replay`
- `consultant workshop recording`
- `free masterclass coach`
- `webinar for coaches`
- `"join my webinar"` (use quotes for exact match)
- `"webinar replay"` coach OR consultant
- `course creator content strategy`
- `"I hosted a webinar"`
- `"webinar recording"` coaching

**Search terms — podcast hosts who interview coaches:**
- `"new episode" coach interview`
- `"on the podcast" coaching`
- `podcast host coaching consultant`
- `"latest episode" coach`
- `"had [name] on the show"` coaching

**Search terms — coaches who appeared as podcast guests:**
- `"I was on" podcast coach`
- `"had me on" podcast coaching`
- `"grateful to be on" podcast`
- `"great conversation" podcast coach`
- `"episode is live" coaching`

**What to do after searching:**
1. Click on "Posts" tab to find people actively promoting webinars or podcast appearances
2. Click through to their profile
3. Check their recent activity — are they posting regularly? Do they clearly run webinars or appear on podcasts?
4. Look for a website link in their profile header or About section
5. For podcast guests: check if they posted any clips or content from the episode (if they didn't — that's your opening with Message #7)

### YouTube Search Queries — Webinars

YouTube is the easiest place to find coaches who have recorded webinars sitting publicly.

**Search terms:**
- `coaching webinar replay`
- `consultant masterclass`
- `[niche] webinar` (e.g., "business coach webinar", "health coach masterclass")
- `free workshop [niche]`
- `live training coach`
- `webinar replay coaching program`

**What to do after finding a video:**
1. Check the channel — is it a real coach/consultant with a business?
2. Look at their About page for website and email
3. Check description for links to their site, lead magnet, or booking page
4. Note specific timestamps or insights from their webinar to reference in your outreach
5. Check subscriber count — 500-50,000 subscribers is the sweet spot (big enough to be serious, small enough to actually read your message)

### YouTube Search Queries — Podcast Interviews (for Guest Content Kit angle)

Find podcasts that interview coaches and consultants. Each host is a potential partner. Each guest is a potential client.

**Search terms to find podcast hosts:**
- `coaching podcast interview`
- `coach interview podcast`
- `[niche] coach podcast` (e.g., "business coach podcast", "life coach interview")
- `consultant interview show`
- `coaching business podcast`
- `entrepreneur coach conversation`

**Search terms to find specific guests:**
- `[coach name] interview` (if you already know a coach's name)
- `[coach name] podcast`
- `coaching tips interview`
- `consultant shares` podcast

**What to do after finding a podcast episode:**
1. **For the host:** Check how often they upload. Do they have guests regularly? Look at their subscriber count and engagement. Find their website/email in the About section or episode description.
2. **For the guest:** Click through to the guest's own channel or LinkedIn. Are they a coach/consultant? Do they run webinars? Check if they posted anything about this episode on their own social media (if they didn't — that's your opening).
3. Watch 10-15 minutes of the episode. Note the guest's strongest moments — specific frameworks, surprising insights, quotable lines. You'll reference these in your outreach.
4. **The sweet spot:** Podcasts with 1,000-50,000 subscribers that interview coaches/consultants regularly. Big enough to have good guests, small enough that the host reads DMs.

### Facebook Groups to Join

Search Facebook for these group types and request to join. Lurk for a few days before engaging.

**Group search terms:**
- `coaches content creation`
- `online coaches community`
- `course creators`
- `coaching business growth`
- `consultants marketing`
- `digital course creators`

**Specific group types to look for:**
- Groups run by coaches about building coaching businesses
- Content marketing groups for service providers
- Skool communities for coaches and consultants
- Groups where people share their webinar replays for feedback

**How to engage (do NOT just spam your offer):**
1. Join and observe for 2-3 days
2. Comment helpfully on other people's posts first
3. Wait for someone to post about content struggles, repurposing, or being stuck
4. Reply to THAT post with your offer (use Message #5 above)
5. Never create your own promotional post unless the group explicitly allows it

### Skool Communities

Search on skool.com/discovery for communities related to:
- Coaching
- Course creation
- Content marketing
- Online business

Many coaches run free or paid Skool communities and also run webinars as part of their community.

### Signs Someone Is a Good Fit

**Strong fit (reach out immediately):**
- They have recorded webinars on YouTube or their website
- They appeared as a guest on a podcast and didn't post anything about it (use Message #7)
- They post on LinkedIn but inconsistently (content gap you can fill)
- They mention struggling with content in a post or comment
- They have a lead magnet or email list (they understand the value of content)
- They sell coaching packages between $2K-$20K (they can afford the paid service later)
- They have a website with a blog that hasn't been updated recently

**Strong fit — podcast hosts (reach out with Message #6):**
- They run a podcast/YouTube show that interviews coaches or consultants
- They upload regularly (at least 2x/month)
- Their guests don't seem to be promoting the episodes on their own channels
- They have 1,000-50,000 subscribers (big enough for good guests, small enough to read DMs)

**Decent fit (worth reaching out):**
- They run a podcast and occasionally do webinars
- They're active on LinkedIn but don't repurpose content across platforms
- They have a course or group program (lots of recorded content)

**Not a good fit (skip):**
- Brand new coaches with no recorded content at all
- Coaches who already have a content team or VA doing repurposing
- People with huge audiences (100K+ followers) — they won't see your message
- Anyone who only does 1:1 coaching with no content presence

### Outreach Tracking

Keep it simple. Use a spreadsheet with these columns:

| Name | Type | Platform Found | Content Topic | Message Sent | Date Sent | Follow-up Date | Response | Notes |
|------|------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|----------|-------|
| | Coach / Host / Guest | | | DM v1 / v2 / Email / Host / Guest | | | Y/N/Pending | |

**Daily target:** Send 10-15 personalized messages per day. Mix of direct coach outreach (Messages #1-3), podcast host pitches (Message #6), and podcast guest outreach (Message #7). Personalization matters more than volume.
