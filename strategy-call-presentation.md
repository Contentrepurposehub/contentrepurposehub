*Strategy Call*

## SLIDE 2: Today's Agenda

Here's what we'll do in the next 20 minutes:

1. I'll learn about your situation (your webinars, your content, your goals)
2. I'll show you what's possible with what you already have
3. If it makes sense, I'll show you how we can help
4. You'll leave with a clear picture either way

This is a conversation. Ask questions anytime.

---

## SLIDE 3: What Brought You Here?

**Tell me about your content situation right now.**

[Listen. Take notes. Use their exact words later.]

What to listen for:
- How many webinars they've done
- What happens to recordings after
- Current content creation process
- Time spent on content per week
- What's frustrating them

---

## SLIDE 4: The Problem

You already did the hard work.

You spent 4-6 hours preparing and delivering a webinar. The thinking, the teaching, the stories, the frameworks — all captured on a recording.

Then what happened?

It went into a folder. Maybe you uploaded the replay. Then you moved on and started creating content from scratch again.

**That recording contains enough material for 14-75 content pieces.** Blog posts, LinkedIn posts, lead magnets, email sequences, newsletters.

You're not missing content. You're missing extraction.

---

## SLIDE 5: What This Actually Costs You

Let's do the math with your numbers.

**The opportunity cost of DIY content creation:**

| Your hourly rate | Hours on content/month | Monthly cost |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| $200/hour | 15 hours | **$3,000/month** |
| $300/hour | 15 hours | **$4,500/month** |
| $500/hour | 15 hours | **$7,500/month** |

That's $36,000-$90,000 per year in time you could spend coaching clients.

Meanwhile, one webinar sitting in a folder = 14-75 content pieces nobody's creating.

---

## SLIDE 6: What We Do

**You send us a webinar recording. We send you back ready-to-publish content.**

No learning new tools. No hiring writers. No spending your weekends repurposing.

We watch your webinar, extract every valuable moment, and create content pieces in your voice — because we're using your actual words, stories, and examples.

Every piece is optimized for two things:
1. **Google search** — so new people find you
2. **AI search** — so ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini cite you

---

## SLIDE 7: What You Get Back (Starter Example)

**From one 60-minute webinar:**

| Content Type | What It Does For You |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 1 Lead Magnet (PDF) | Builds your email list on autopilot |
| 10 LinkedIn Posts | Positions you as the authority, drives engagement |
| 1 SEO Blog Post (1,500-2,500 words) | Ranks on Google, drives traffic for years |
| 1 Newsletter Edition | Nurtures your existing audience |
| 1 Landing Page Copy | Converts visitors into leads |

**14 pieces. From content you already created.**

All written in your voice. All optimized for search. Delivered in 7-10 business days.

---

## SLIDE 8: The AI Search Advantage

This is the part most people miss.

**How people find experts is changing.**

Right now, someone looking for a coach asks Google. Soon — and increasingly already — they ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini: "Who's the best coach for [your topic]?"

If your content isn't structured for AI citation, you're invisible to that entire channel.

**We structure every piece for both Google AND AI search engines.** This is not something freelancers or generic agencies do. We're the only webinar repurposing service with dual search optimization built in.

---

## SLIDE 9: The Market Reality

**You're in a unique position right now.**

- 122,974 coaches globally. 58% use webinars. Almost none repurpose them properly.
- The "webinar repurposing" keyword space has near-zero competition.
- Nobody has claimed the authority position for webinar repurposing for coaches.

The coaches who build their content library now — optimized for Google and AI search — will be the ones people find in 6 months, 12 months, 2 years.

Content compounds. The earlier you start, the bigger the advantage.

## SLIDE 11: The Math That Matters

**What you're comparing this to:**

| Option | Cost | Content Pieces | SEO Optimized? | AI Search Optimized? |
|--------|------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Freelance writer | $200-$500/piece | 1 | Maybe | No |
| Generic agency | $2,000-$5,000/mo | 8-12 | Yes | No |
| DIY with AI tools | $100/mo + 15-20 hrs | Varies | If you know how | No |
| **ContentRepurposeHub** | **$750-$1,500/mo** | **14-75+** | **Yes** | **Yes** |

At $750/month, you get 14 pieces at $54 each — with Google AND AI optimization included.

A freelance writer charges $200-$500 for one piece. Without SEO. Without AI optimization.

---

## SLIDE 12: Which Plan Fits You?

**Based on what you told me, here's what I'd recommend:**

[Recommend ONE plan based on their situation]

**Starter ($750/month)** — if you do one webinar per month and want to see how this works before going bigger.

**Growth ($1,000/month)** — if you have multiple webinars or want the email sequences that convert your list into clients. This is where most coaches land.

**Scale ($1,500/month)** — if you have a library of recordings and want content across every platform. Full content engine.

---

## SLIDE 13: How It Works

**Step 1:** You send us your webinar recording (Zoom, YouTube, Loom — any format)

**Step 2:** We watch it, extract every valuable moment, and create your content

**Step 3:** You receive everything in a Google Doc within 7-10 business days

**Step 4:** You review, request any changes, and publish

That's it. You keep doing webinars. We handle the content.

---

## SLIDE 14: Common Questions

**Q: How do you match my voice?**
We use your actual words from the webinar. We don't make things up — we extract and restructure what you said. The content sounds like you because it IS you.

**Q: What if I don't like something?**
You approve everything before it goes anywhere. Unlimited revisions on each delivery.

**Q: What if my webinar wasn't that polished?**
If you taught something useful, we can work with it. We're looking for your insights, not production quality.

**Q: What about older recordings?**
They work great. Some coaches start by repurposing their backlog — 3, 5, even 10 webinars sitting unused.

---

## SLIDE 15: What Happens Next

If this feels right:

1. You pick the plan that fits
2. We send you a simple onboarding form (5 minutes)
3. You upload your first webinar recording
4. We deliver your first content batch in 7-10 business days
5. You review, publish, and start seeing results

**Which plan are you leaning toward?**
