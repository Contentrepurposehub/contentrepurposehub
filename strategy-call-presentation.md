## SLIDE 1: Welcome

**ContentRepurposeHub**

*Strategy Call*

[Your name]
[Date]

---

## SLIDE 2: How This Call Works

Here's what we'll do in the next 20 minutes:

1. I'll ask about your situation — your webinars, your content, your goals
2. We'll look at what you're leaving on the table
3. If I see a way to help, I'll show you how
4. If I don't think we're a fit, I'll tell you

This is a conversation, not a pitch. Ask me anything along the way.

---

## SLIDE 3: Tell Me About You

**What's going on with your content right now?**

[Listen. Take notes. Write down their exact words — you'll use them later.]

What to listen for:
- How many webinars they've done
- What happens to recordings after
- How they're creating content now
- How much time they spend on it per week
- What's frustrating them

---

## SLIDE 4: The Problem

You already did the hard part.

You spent hours preparing and delivering a webinar. The thinking, the teaching, the stories, the frameworks — all captured on a recording.

Then what happened?

It went into a folder. Maybe you posted the replay. Then you went back to creating content from scratch.

**That recording has enough material for 14-75 content pieces.** Blog posts, LinkedIn posts, lead magnets, email sequences, newsletters.

You don't have a content problem. You have an extraction problem.

---

## SLIDE 5: What This Actually Costs You

Let's do the math with YOUR numbers.

**The time you're spending on content instead of coaching:**

| Your hourly rate | Hours on content/month | What that costs you |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| $200/hour | 15 hours | **$3,000/month** |
| $300/hour | 15 hours | **$4,500/month** |
| $500/hour | 15 hours | **$7,500/month** |

That's $36,000-$90,000 a year in time you could spend on clients.

And every webinar sitting in a folder = 14-75 content pieces nobody's creating.

---

## SLIDE 6: What We Do

**You send us a webinar recording. We send you back ready-to-publish content.**

No learning new tools. No hiring writers. No spending weekends on content.

But we don't just cut your webinar into clips. There's a process behind it.

---

## SLIDE 7: How We Actually Create Your Content

Most repurposing services transcribe your webinar, chop it up, and send you back generic posts. That's editing, not strategy.

Here's what we do differently:

**1. We capture your voice first**
Before we create anything, we study how you speak — your phrases, your rhythm, the way you explain things. Every piece we create sounds like you wrote it. Not a freelancer. Not AI. You.

**2. We find your strongest angles**
Your webinar has dozens of ideas. Some are good. A few are great. We identify which ones your audience will respond to most and build content around those first.

**3. We research what your audience actually searches**
The blog post isn't just a cleaned-up transcription. We find the exact keywords your ideal clients type into Google and write the post to rank for those terms.

**4. We build each piece for the platform it lives on**
A LinkedIn post follows LinkedIn patterns. An email sequence follows proven conversion frameworks. A lead magnet is designed to capture emails, not just summarize your slides. Each piece is built for where it works, not copy-pasted across platforms.

**The result:** Content that sounds like you, ranks on Google, gets found by AI search tools, and actually converts — all from a webinar you already delivered.

---

## SLIDE 8: What You Get Back (from one webinar)

| Content Type | What It Does For You |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 1 Lead Magnet (PDF) | Builds your email list on autopilot |
| 10 LinkedIn Posts | Positions you as the go-to person, drives engagement |
| 1 SEO Blog Post (1,500-2,500 words) | Shows up on Google, drives traffic for years |
| 1 Newsletter Edition | Keeps your existing audience warm |
| 1 Landing Page Copy | Turns visitors into leads |

**14 pieces. From content you already created.**

All in your voice. All optimized for search. Delivered in 7-10 business days.

---

## SLIDE 9: The AI Search Advantage

This is the part most people miss.

**How people find experts is changing.**

Right now, someone looking for a coach searches Google. But more and more, they're asking ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini: "Who's a good coach for [your topic]?"

If your content isn't set up for AI to find and cite you, you're invisible to all those people.

**We build every piece for Google AND AI search.** This is not something freelancers or agencies do. We're the only webinar repurposing service that does this.

---

## SLIDE 10: Why Now Matters

**You're in a unique spot right now.**

- 122,974 coaches globally. 58% use webinars. Almost none repurpose them well.
- The "webinar repurposing" space has almost zero competition online.
- Nobody has claimed the authority position for webinar content in your niche yet.

The coaches who build their content library now — optimized for Google and AI — will be the ones people find in 6 months, 12 months, 2 years.

Content compounds. The earlier you start, the bigger your head start.

## SLIDE 12: Compare Your Options

| Option | Cost | Pieces | Google Optimized? | AI Search Optimized? |
|--------|------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Freelance writer | $200-$500/piece | 1 | Maybe | No |
| Generic agency | $2,000-$5,000/mo | 8-12 | Yes | No |
| DIY with AI tools | $100/mo + 15-20 hrs | Varies | If you know how | No |
| **ContentRepurposeHub** | **$750-$1,500/mo** | **14-75+** | **Yes** | **Yes** |

At $750/month you get 14 pieces at $54 each — with Google AND AI optimization.

A freelancer charges $200-$500 for one piece. Without the optimization.

---

## SLIDE 13: What I'd Recommend For You

**Based on what you told me:**

[Pick ONE plan based on their situation]

**Starter ($750/month)** — if you do one webinar a month and want to see how this works first.

**Growth ($1,000/month)** — if you have multiple webinars or want email sequences that turn subscribers into clients. Where most coaches land.

**Scale ($1,500/month)** — if you have a library of recordings and want content everywhere. Full content engine.

First month is a test. If the content doesn't sound like you or the quality isn't there, you cancel. No contract. You keep everything we made.

---

## SLIDE 14: How It Works

**Step 1:** You send us your webinar recording (Zoom, YouTube, Loom — any format)

**Step 2:** We watch it, pull out every valuable moment, and create your content

**Step 3:** You get everything in a Google Doc within 7-10 business days

**Step 4:** You review, request any changes, and publish

That's it. You keep doing webinars. We handle the content.

---

## SLIDE 15: Common Questions

**How do you match my voice?**
Before we create a single piece, we analyze how you speak — your phrases, your tone, how you explain things. We build a voice profile from your webinar. Then every piece is written through that filter. It sounds like you because it's built from the way you actually talk.

**What if I don't like something?**
You approve everything before it goes anywhere. Unlimited revisions on each delivery.

**What if my webinar wasn't that polished?**
If you taught something useful, we can work with it. We're looking for your ideas, not production quality.

**What about older recordings?**
They work great. Some coaches start by repurposing their backlog — 3, 5, even 10 webinars they never used.

---

## SLIDE 16: What Happens Next

If this feels right:

1. You pick the plan that fits
2. We send you a simple onboarding form (5 minutes)
3. You upload your first webinar recording
4. We send your first content batch in 7-10 business days
5. You review, publish, and start seeing results

**Does this feel right for where you are?**
